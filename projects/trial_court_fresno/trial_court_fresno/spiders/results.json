In order to legally evict a tenant (remove and lock the tenant out of the property), the landlord must file an Unlawful Detainer lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Responding to an Unlawful Detainer Lawsuit</h3>\n\nIf you are served with an Unlawful Detainer complaint, the complaint will show the court location where you should file your answer. You have five days to respond in writing to the landlord's complaint. After you have filed your written answer to the landlord's complaint in the clerk's office and an At Issue Memorandum is filed by the plaintiff, you will both be notified by mail of the time and place of trial. There is a filing fee when you file your written answer. However, it is possible to obtain a waiver of the fee if you cannot afford to pay. In order to obtain a fee waiver, you must file an Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs at the time you file your answer. The Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs form may be obtained from the Clerk's Office.\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Writs of Possession and Notices to Vacate</h3>\n\nIf the case goes to trial and the landlord wins the Unlawful Detainer lawsuit, the court will issue a judgment for possession. To enforce the judgment, the landlord will then obtain a Writ of Possession that directs the Sheriff to enforce the judgment for possession of the property. This legal document authorizes the Sheriff to physically remove and lock you out of the property. The Sheriff's cost from the eviction may be added to the judgment, which the landlord can collect from you.\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Sheriff will serve you with a Notice to Vacate the property before enforcing the Writ of Possession. After the Sheriff serves the notice, you have five days to move. If you fail to move within the five days, the Sheriff will physically remove you and turn over the possession of the property to the landlord.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h3>Failure to respond to the Unlawful Detainer Lawsuit</h3>\n\nThe court may enter a default judgment in favor of the landlord and issue a Writ of Possession after the 5th day if you fail to respond. There is no trial if you do not file a written response to the Unlawful Detainer complaint.  This default judgment allows the landlord to obtain possession of the property through a Notice to Vacate.\n\n\n\n<h3>The Right to a Jury Trial</h3>\n\nBoth parties have the right to a jury trial. To request a jury trial, the requesting party must file a document entitled At Issue Memorandum. If one party files an At Issue Memorandum and does not request a jury trial, the other party has five days from the mailing date of the At Issue Memorandum to file a Counter At Issue Memorandum requesting a jury trial. All appearing parties will be mailed a Notice of Calendar Setting informing them of the trial date. The party requesting a jury trial will be responsible for paying the jury fee deposit which must be posted with the court five days before the trial date.\n\n<h3>Changing a Trial Date</h3>\n\nTo change your trial date, you need to file one of the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Motion for Continuance</li>\n\n\t<li>Written Stipulation (agreement by both parties) along with a declaration showing a good reason for the continuance and an order</li>\n\n\t<li>A Declaration showing a good reason for the continuance and an order</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The paperwork must be filed as soon as the need for a continuance is known. A filing fee is required.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h3>Preparing for Trial</h3>\n\nIf you are not represented by an attorney, you can represent yourself.

The use of State Certified and State Registered Interpreters are provided to assist the non-English party in their court proceeding.  However, due to a shortage of certified/registered interpreters statewide the court may provide a provisionally qualified interpreter (non-certified, non-registered).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, through a grant provided by the Judicial Council, Administrative Office of the Courts, we are currently providing interpreters for indigent litigants in family law cases where a Domestic Violence restraining order was sought or issued.</p>\n<p>If you are involved in a proceeding for a criminal, traffic, juvenile, or domestic violence matter, you may ask the clerk at the counter or the clerk in the courtroom for an interpreter. If an interpreter is not available at the time of your hearing, the Court may continue your case until an interpreter can be assigned.</p>\n<p>If you need an interpreter in any language other than Spanish, you should notify the court as soon as possible as to your language need. If you wait until your court date, you may have to wait until an interpreter can be contacted, or your matter may be continued to a future date.</p>\n<p>For information on obtaining an interpreter, please contact the Interpreters' Office at (559) 457-4910.</p>\n<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2>\nIf you require the services of a sign language interpreter, you may request one at any facility, for any type of hearing you may have.

The Volunteer Interpreter Bureau is made up of volunteers drawn from community agencies, as well as educational institutions that assist self-represented litigants with translations at the Center or in Court.  The volunteer interpreters are tested by the court\ufffds Interpreter Department Manager and placed according to their skill level.  Certified court interpreters mentor those who are selected for use in the courtroom until they are ready to assist litigants on their own.  Most of the volunteers aspire to become certified court interpreters and their ability to assist as a volunteer enables them to strengthen their skills in preparation of the State exam.\n<p><strong>If you are fluent in English and Spanish - Become a Volunteer Interpreter through the Centro De Recursos Legales (Spanish Self-Help Center)</strong></p>\n<p>As a Volunteer Interpreter you can:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Help our Spanish-speaking community gain equal access to our Court system.</li>\n\t<li>Explore interpreting as a career.</li>\n\t<li>Be mentored by a Certified Court Interpreter and gain first-hand experience in the exciting world of interpreting.</li>\n\t<li>Be a part of helping others help themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you are interested in becoming a Volunteer, call (559) 497-7820</strong></p>\n-->\n<p>If you are interested in becoming a Certified Interpreter, visit <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/7996.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AOC's Becoming an Interpreter home page</a>.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"1\"></a><h2>Common Civil Unlimited Time Frames</h2>\n\n<strong>Service, Return of Summons</strong>\n\n<p>Serve all named defendants, and file proof of service with the court, within 60 days from the date the complaint is filed.

It raises issues of law, not fact.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, a demurrer to a complaint or cross-complaint asserts that, even if all the facts alleged in the complaint or cross-complaint are true, they do not state a claim the law recognizes; that is, they do not state a claim for which the court can grant relief.  A demurrer may also assert other deficiencies, for example, that the court does not have jurisdiction of the claim asserted in the complaint or cross-complaint, that the claim is already before the court in another case, that the proper parties have not been included in the case, or that the responding party cannot understand what is being alleged.  (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 430.10.)</p>\n\n<p>Generally, a demurrer to an answer asserts that, even if all the facts alleged in the answer are true, they do not constitute a defense to the claims alleged in the complaint.  It may also assert that the answer cannot be understood.  (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 430.20.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>When must demurrers be filed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The demurrer to a complaint or cross-complaint must be filed and served within 30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 430.40(a), 432.10.)  In unlawful detainer actions, a demurrer to the complaint must be filed and served within 5 days after service of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1167, 1170.)</p>\n\n<p>A demurrer to an answer must be filed within 10 days after service of the answer. (Code Civ.

(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1304(b).)  Plaintiff may file a first amended complaint while a demurrer to the original complaint is pending; the first amended complaint supersedes the original and renders the demurrer moot.  (Code Civ.

It is not all-inclusive and is meant to be a guide only.  Litigants representing themselves are still encouraged to seek the advice of counsel.\n\n<p><strong>What is discovery?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Discovery is the term used for obtaining information that will help a litigant prosecute or defend the action from other parties to the lawsuit and in some instances, from persons and entities that are not parties to the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I obtain this information?</strong></p>\n\n<p>By propounding (picking and choosing from among pre-formatted questions or forming your own) and serving form interrogatories, specially prepared interrogatories, requests for admissions, inspection demands and notice of depositions.  Various types of form interrogatories, requests for admissions, inspection demands and notices of depositions can be obtained from the Book of Judicial Council Forms or books of discovery forms available from legal publishing companies.  The rules for discovery and for each different <strong>type</strong> of discovery are set forth in the <strong>Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 2016 et seq</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Time limits for discovery in general</strong></p>\n\n<p>Generally, a case must be <strong>pending</strong> before discovery can begin.  See CCP \u00a7 2017.  Plaintiffs must obtain a court order based upon a showing of \"good cause\" to begin discovery during the first 10 days (20 days for a deposition) after a defendant is served with the summons or has appeared in the action (in most cases by filing an Answer.)  No such \"waiting period\" applies to defendants.  The right to discovery (seek more information) is \"cut-off\" 30 days before trial.  A motion concerning discovery must be heard by the Court at least 15 days before trial.   If the trial date is continued, this does not mean that the \"cut-off\" dates concerning discovery are continued as well.  See CCP \u00a7 2024.  Unless permission is obtained from the Court, the discovery \"cut-off\" dates are calculated from the initial trial date.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>Limits on discovery</strong></p>\n\n<p>CCP \u00a7 2017.010 states that the information sought must be (1) \"not privileged\", (2) \"relevant to the subject matter of the action\", and (3) either admissible or \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"  There are many categories of information that are protected by statute or by the constitutional right of privacy from discovery.  It is advisable to consult a treatise concerning the scope of discovery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IF YOU ARE REPRESENTING YOURSELF SEVERE CONSEQUENCES CAN RESULT FROM A FAILURE TO RESPOND TO DISCOVERY SERVED UPON YOU BY THE OTHER PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT</strong>.  If you are the plaintiff, your lawsuit can be dismissed.  If you are a defendant, default can be entered.  See CCP \u00a7 2023.  To reiterate, it is advisable to consult with an attorney if you wish to sue or if you are sued.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Motions to compel</strong></p>\n\n<p>In general, two types of motions to compel are commonly filed.  A motion to compel initial responses is addressed to one or more of the following types of discovery: form interrogatories, specially drafted interrogatories, inspection demands (not \"requests for production\"), and requests for admission.   The governing statutes are CCP \u00a7\u00a7 2030.290, 2031.300 and 2033.280 respectively.  (CCP \u00a7 2030 applies to both form and specially drafted interrogatories.)  This type of motion is filed when a party fails to serve a verified response. Verification means that the party providing the responses (answers) states under penalty of perjury of the laws of the State of California that the responses are true and correct.  See CCP \u00a7 2015.5.  The qualification \"verified\" is used because an unverified response is tantamount to no response at all.  See Appleton v. Sup. Ct. (Cook) (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.  Responses are served on the attorney for the opposing party or the opposing party if it is representing itself.  They are not filed with the Court.  See CCP \u00a7\u00a7 2030.280, 2031.290 and 2033.270.  Failure to respond timely results in a waiver of objections (subject to a few exceptions not dealt with here).  See CCP \u00a7 2030.290, 2031.300 and 2033.280.</p>\n\n<p>A motion to compel initial responses to requests for admission is a special type of motion.  Failure to respond before the hearing on the motion to compel means that all of the \"matters\" (facts) set forth in the requests for admission are deemed established as true.  See CCP \u00a7 2033.280.    For example, one party requests (asks) the other party to admit that he or she \"ran the red light\".  No response is served.  At the hearing, the Court will deem the fact as established--the party did \"run the red light\".  Moreover, sanctions are mandatory for failure to respond to requests for admission.  See Appleton v. Sup. Ct. (Cook) (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.</p>\n\n<p>The second type of motion is a motion to compel further responses.  It is also addressed to one or more of the following types of discovery: form interrogatories, specially drafted interrogatories, inspection demands (not \"requests for production\"), and requests for admission.  The governing statutes are CCP \u00a7\u00a7 2030.300, 2031.310 and 2033.290 respectively.   This type of motion is filed when the party that propounded the questions is not satisfied with the responses received.  All of the statutes governing motions to compel further responses require a \"meet and confer in good faith\" effort to resolve the dispute prior to filing the motion.  All of the statutes also require that the motion to compel be served within 45 days of service of the unsatisfactory responses (plus five days extension of time if responses served by mail).   The only exception requires a written agreement between the parties involved extending time to file the motion.   The deadline has been held to be \"quasi-jurisdictional\"--court cannot rule on motion filed beyond 45-day limit or without written agreement extending time.  See Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (1983) 147 Cal.App. 3d 681; Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 745 and Sexton v. Sup. Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.  See also Standon Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Kim) (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 903.</p>\n\n<p>There are common mistakes regarding motions to compel initial and further responses to inspection demands.  First, a motion to compel initial responses to inspection demands seeks a written response within the parameters of CCP \u00a7 2031.240.  Producing documents in lieu of serving a written response is not compliance.  See CCP \u00a7 2031.240 and 2031.260.  Second, if in the written responses, the other party agreed to produce the documents for inspection and copying and then that party fails to produce, the remedy is a motion to compel compliance \"as agreed upon\".  It is governed by CCP \u00a7 2031.320.  It does not fall within the parameters of subsection (m).  Third, any motion to compel further responses to inspection demands must show \"good cause\" for inspection.   See CCP \u00a7 2031.310.  This showing requires the moving party to set forth specific facts addressing the need to inspect the particular documents in dispute.  It is insufficient to state that they need to be reviewed for context or similar reason.  See Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (Paine Webber Real Estate Securities) (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1138.</p>\n\n<p>There are also various types of motions governing other means of discovery--depositions, physical examinations, mental examinations, expert witness designation, etc.  These are more complicated motions and are not dealt with here.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"5\"></a><h2>Ex Parte</h2>\n\n<strong>When is an \"Ex Parte\" application appropriate?</strong>\n\n<p>An ex parte application for a court order, being an exception to the general requirement of serving a regularly noticed motion under CCP 1005, is permitted only in limited circumstances.  In every case, the application must make the necessary \"affirmative factual showing\" to support the particular relief being obtained on an ex parte basis [See, CRC Rule 3.1202c].</p>\n\n<p>Ex parte relief is most frequently sought in situations where there is a pressing need for immediate relief such that waiting to hear the matter on regularly noticed motion would cause prejudice or harm.  However, to obtain ex parte relief on this basis, the party must make an affirmative showing to justify the departure from the standard noticed motion procedure set forth at CCP 1005.  An example of this type of ex parte request is an application for an order shortening time to serve notice of an urgently needed motion.  An application for an order shortening time must be supported by a declaration that makes an adequate showing of \"good cause\" for such relief. [CRC Rule 3.1300(b)].  Another example of this sort is an application for an ex parte writ of attachment, temporary restraining order or other provisional remedy needed on an urgent basis.  Whenever provisional remedies are sought, the application must show full compliance with all requirements of the applicable statute or other law authorizing such provisional relief on an ex parte basis.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, ex parte relief may be sought in many other circumstances, and only the most common situations have been enumerated here.  Other examples of when ex parte relief may be appropriate include (but are not limited to) certain preliminary matters in which no adverse party is affected by the relief (e.g., applications to appoint a guardian ad litem or for service by publication), and where applicable law specifically permits the relief to be obtained on an ex parte basis (e.g., CRC Rule 3.1320(h) [request for dismissal for failure to amend after demurrer sustained]).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to obtain a hearing date and file papers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parties making ex parte applications shall obtain a date and time for the hearing of the application from the Clerk (Civil Calendar Division).  The court requests that the party seeking an ex parte order submit the application and all supporting papers and fees to the Clerk (in Room 401 at main courthouse) for filing not later than 9:00 on the date of the hearing.  (See, Fresno County Superior Court, Local Rule 2.7).</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>CRC Rule 3.1200-3.1207 notice and other procedural requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parties seeking ex parte relief must comply with all statutes, rules and case law applicable to the specific relief being sought.  For example, if a provisional remedy such as a temporary restraining order, writ of attachment, etc., is sought, the party must show full compliance with the particular statutes and other laws applicable to such provisional remedy.  In addition, Rule 3.1200 to 3.1207 of the California Rules of Court sets forth a number of mandatory rules relating to all ex parte applications.  Applications for ex parte orders failing to comply with Rule 3.1200 to 3.1207 will be rejected.   Here are a few of the essential requirements of Rule 3.1200 to 3.1207 which parties often fail to comply with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li type=\"a\">Time of  Notice.  A party seeking an ex parte order must notify all parties no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance, absent a showing of exceptional circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice.  (CRC Rule 3.1203).  If the party believes that notice to the opposing party should not be required, the reasons must be clearly specified.  (CRC Rule 3.1204(b)(3)).</li>\n\n\t<li type=\"a\">Contents of Notice.  When notice of an ex parte application is given, the person giving notice must state with specificity the nature of the relief to be requested and the date, time, and place for the presentation of the application, and must attempt to determine whether the opposing party will appear to oppose the application.  (CRC Rule 31204(a)).</li>\n\n\t<li type=\"a\">Contents of Declaration.  An ex parte application for an order must be accompanied by a declaration showing that the notice requirements under Rule 312 et seq. have been fully complied with.  (CRC Rule 3.1201, 3.1203 and 3.1204).  The declaration regarding notice must include the following:  (1) the notice given, including the date, time, manner, and name of the party informed, the relief sought, any response, and whether opposition is expected; or (2) why notice should not be required; or (3) if notice was provided later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance, the exceptional circumstances that justify the shorter notice.  (CRC Rule 3.1203(a)).</li>\n\n\t<li type=\"a\">Affirmative Factual Showing Required.  An application must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  (CRC Rule 3.1202(c)).</li>\n\n\t<li type=\"a\">Service of Papers.  Parties appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the ex parte application or any written opposition on all other appearing parties at the first reasonable opportunity.  Absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be conducted unless such service has been made.  (CRC Rule 3.1206).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Order shortening time</strong></p>\n\n<p>When a party applies to the court for an ex parte order to shorten the time for filing and service of notice of motion (See, CCP 1005), the request must be adequately supported by a declaration showing \"good cause\" to justify the relief. (CRC Rule 3.1300(b)).  Failure to show \"good cause\" is one of the most frequent grounds for denial of such ex parte applications.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"6\"></a>\n\n<h2>Summary Judgment Motions</h2>\n\n<strong>When should I serve a motion for summary judgment/adjudication?</strong>\n\n<p>Motions for summary judgment/adjudication may be served at any time after 60 days have elapsed since the general appearance of the party against whom the motion is directed.  (CCP \u00a7 437c(a).)  Also, the motion must be served at least 75 days before the hearing date, increased by 5 days if service is by mail if the address is within California, 10 days if the address is outside California but within the United States, and 20 days if the address is outside the United States.  (Ibid.)  The court does not have jurisdiction to hear motions that are not served in a timely manner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When should I serve and file opposition?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Any opposition must be served and filed at least 14 days before the hearing date, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.  (CCP \u00a7 437c(b)(2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>When should I serve and file the reply?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reply must be served and filed at least 5 days before the hearing date, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.  (CCP \u00a7 437c(b)(4).)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I obtain an order shortening time for service on a motion for summary judgment/adjudication?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No.  The court does not have the authority to shorten the time for notice of a summary judgment motion.  (McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112, 118.)</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>Can I file a joinder to another party's motion for summary judgment/adjudication?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. A joinder to summary judgment motion that does not contain its own notice of motion and separate statement of undisputed facts does not constitute a valid summary judgment motion, and the court cannot grant summary judgment based upon such a joinder.  (Village Nurseries, L.P. v. Greenbaum (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 26, 47.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What constitutes a valid separate statement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The separate statement must separately identify each cause of action, claim, issue of duty, or affirmative defense, and each supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with respect to the cause of action, claim, issue of duty, or affirmative defense.  (CRC 3.1350.)  The statement must be in a two-column format, with the undisputed material facts in numerical sequence in the first column and the evidence that establishes those undisputed facts in the second column.  (Ibid.)  Citation to the evidence in support of each material fact must include reference to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.  (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What constitutes a valid opposing separate statement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The opposing separate statement must set out verbatim on the left side of the page the facts claimed by the moving party to be undisputed.  (CRC 3.1350(f).)  Below the asserted undisputed facts, the statement must set forth the evidence said to establish that fact, complete with the moving party's references to exhibits.  (Ibid.)  On the right side of the page, directly opposite the recitation of the moving party's statement of material facts and supporting evidence, the response must unequivocally state whether that fact is \"disputed\" or \"undisputed\".  (Ibid.)  If the opposing party contends there is a dispute, the party must state on the right side of the page, directly opposite the fact in dispute, the nature of the dispute and describe the evidence that supports the position that the fact is controverted.  (Ibid.)  That evidence must be supported by citation to exhibit, title, page, and line numbers in the evidence submitted.  (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>May I obtain summary adjudication when the notice of motion specifies only a request for summary judgment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No.  The notice of motion must specifically request that the moving party seeks summary adjudication in the alternative to summary judgment in order for the court to grant summary adjudication of individual claims, causes of action, or issues.  (Homestead Savings v. Superior Court (Dividend Development Corp.) (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 494, 498.)  Otherwise, if there is a single triable issue as to any material fact, the court must deny the entire motion for summary judgment.  (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long can my points and authorities brief be?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The points and authorities in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment/adjudication must be no more than 20 pages long, unless the moving party obtains leave of court.  (CRC 3.1113(d).)  The 20-page limit does not include exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the table of authorities, or the proof of service.  (Ibid.)  The moving party may apply to the court ex parte to file a longer memorandum.  (CRC 3.1113(e).)  However, the party must file the application at least 24 hours before the brief is due, it must give the other parties written notice, and the application must state reasons for the additional pages.  (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can an attorney file a declaration in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment/adjudication?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Normally, an attorney's declaration is only sufficient if the facts stated are matters of which the attorney would be presumed to have personal knowledge, in other words, matters occurring during the course of the lawsuit.  Otherwise, the declaration is generally inadmissible for lack of personal knowledge.  (Maltby v. Shook (1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 349, 351-352.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>May I submit new evidence in my reply?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, no.  New evidence may accompany the reply only in \"the exceptional case.\"  (Plenger v. Alza Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 349, 362, fn. 8.)  If the moving party submits new evidence with the reply, the opposing party is entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond to the new material.

General Information</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n  <li>Judicial  Officer Hilary A. Chittick presides over DUI Court. Court is held every Thursday afternoon at  1:30 pm.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><u>Mission Statement</u></strong><br>\n    The mission of the Fresno County DUI court is to provide offenders with a comprehensive program that will reduce the rate of recidivism and financial burden to the community while enhancing public safety.  This will be accomplished through a coordination of collaborative Court services which include individualized treatment plans, close supervision and judicial involvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li><u><strong>Program Overview</strong></u><br>\n  The Fresno County DUI Court is a court-supervised, comprehensive treatment, collaborative program for eligible participants.  Research conducted for the County of Fresno has revealed that there is a significant amount of cases and growing concern of individuals driving while intoxicated.  The implementation of this treatment court has been made to reduce the rate of recidivism amongst offenders and enhance public safety in our communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similar to other national model DUI court programs, this post adjudication program is designed for adults and operates on a team concept involving increased supervision, mandatory substance abuse treatment, individual/group counseling as well as random and frequent tests to monitor compliance.  Through evidence-based best treatment and supervision practices, participants will learn how to lead healthier and safer lives for themselves and their families while maintaining a clean and sober life.</p>\n  <p>The DUI Court as presently constituted is a single-track treatment model program for High Risk/High Needs defendants charged with subsequent Misdemeanor DUI offenses.  Defendants will first appear in their Home Court Department at which time they will be provided with information as to this treatment Court.  Defendants who are interested in participating will undergo a screening/assessment by the DUI Court Team to insure that they are eligible for the program.  Once approved the participant will plead guilty to the DUI Charges, a jail sentence will be imposed and stayed and they will begin the supervision and treatment program.</p>\n  <p>Defendants who decline participation in the program will be referred back to their home court for continued litigation.  If the defendant later pleads guilty/no contest or is found guilty, they may be referred for re-screening and if still eligible, mandated to participate in the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><u>Track I vs. Track II</u></strong><br>\n    <strong><em>DUI Treatment Court, Track I</em></strong><em> \u2013 Focus on Treatment Needs</em><br>\n  This track operates as traditional DUI courts with focus on the 10 Key Components and is designed to target participants with addiction issues, also referred to as \u201chigh risk high needs.\u201d Treatment is the key component that distinguishes this track from other tracks. Following a triage risk and needs assessment, an ASAM is performed to determine the level of treatment and participants are continuously monitored to identify any potential adjustments in treatment, court appearances or increased monitoring. The court\u2019s goal is to address root issues and that the defendants meet sentencing obligations in order to improve public safety.  Sentencing obligations include continuous alcohol monitoring, such as the ignition interlock device or other alternative monitoring device, educational and treatment programming and possible enrollment into an Adult Offender Work Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>*DUI Compliance Court, Track II (Pending commencement) \u2013 </em></strong><em>Focus on Accountability, Compliance and Prevention</em><br>\n  This track targets repeat offenders who demonstrate substance abuse, but have little to no addiction issues, also referred to as \u201chigh risk low needs\u201d offenders. Consequences will be focused on a participant\u2019s adherence to abstinence and supervision terms. The primary goal of this track is to ensure that participants, while not having a treatment regime to follow, do complete their sentencing obligations while being monitored by the court. This includes monitoring, educational programming, such as the DMV DUI Program.  This may also include installation of ignition interlock devices (IID) or other alternative monitoring devices and possible enrollment into and Adult Offender Work Program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><u>Eligibility</u></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul>\n    <li>DUI Offenders must be 18 years and older</li>\n    <li>Applicants must be residents of Fresno County</li>\n    <li>Applicant must be assessed to be a High Risk/High needs  offender</li>\n    <li>Offense must be for a subsequent DUI Offense (misdemeanor)  listed here:\n      <ul>\n        <li>Driving under the influence - 3rd Offense</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong> Disqualifiers:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Out of County Residents</li>\n    <li>Outstanding Warrants in other Jurisdictions</li>\n    <li>Actively on any type  of supervision other than Conditional Probation</li>\n    <li>Pending Felony Charges or pending violations of Supervision</li>\n    <li>History of convictions within the past 5 years involving any of the following offenses are presupptively disqualified:\n      <ul>\n        <li>Violence</li>\n        <li>Gang Activity</li>\n        <li>Drug Sales</li>\n        <li>Violation of Protective Orders</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>II.

Should you believe  your term of probation will be affected by the changes discussed below, you  should seek legal advice from the attorney who handled your case or another  attorney.</p>\n<p>As of January 1, 2021, Assembly Bill No. 1950 amended Penal Code  sections 1203a and 1203.1 to change the maximum, or longest, term of probation  that can be imposed for most criminal offenses.\u00a0  Under the new changes:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n  <li>Generally, the maximum term of       probation for a misdemeanor offense is no more than one year.\u00a0 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203a, subd. (a).)\u00a0\u00a0 </li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n  <li>Generally, the maximum term of       probation for a felony offense is no more than two years.\u00a0 (Pen.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1203.1, subd.  (m) &amp; 1203a, subd. (b).) Two broad categories of misdemeanor and felony  offenses and three specifically named felony offenses are explicitly excluded  from the new general maximum probationary term limits.\u00a0 (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1203.1, subd. (m); 1203a,  subd. (b).)\u00a0 Therefore, if a person's  only offense, or at least one of a person's offenses, falls within one or more  of these exceptions, the judge may impose a probationary term that is longer  than the new general maximum probationary term limits.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>These changes to the maximum term of probation are applicable to  all cases where probation is granted on or after January 1, 2021.\u00a0 Additionally, these changes also apply to all  cases where a person was granted probation prior to January 1, 2021 and, if no  exceptions are applicable, these changes <strong><u>may</u></strong> reduce the person's previously granted probationary term.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>The law in this area is complex.\u00a0  Therefore, if a person has any questions regarding whether their  probationary term will be shortened because of the changes made by Assembly  Bill No. 1950, the person should contact the attorney who handled the case in  which the person was granted probation.\u00a0  Please do <strong><u>not</u></strong> call the  Superior Court of California, County of Fresno.\u00a0  The court employees answering the phones are unable to provide any legal  advice.<strong> </strong></p>\n\t\t\t<!-- END BODY -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr></table>", "parent": "http://www.fresno.courts.ca.gov/criminal/"},

This is called \"to appeal\" or \"to take an appeal.\" The person that appeals is called the \"appellant.\" The other person is called the \"appellee\" or \"respondent.\"  Generally in an appeal, a higher court reviews the order or judgment of a lower court to see if there was enough evidence to support the judgment or whether errors of law were committed during or before trial, which prejudiced the appealing party.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>If the original decision was made by the Superior Court in an unlimited civil case, the appeal is to the <strong>Court of Appeals</strong>.</li>\n\n\t<li>If the decision being appealed from was in a limited civil case or concerned a misdemeanor or infraction, the appeal is to the <strong>Appellate Division of the Superior Court</strong>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most appeals are limited to a review of the record from the lower court. Parties cannot introduce new evidence, but are limited to what was said and introduced at the original trial. The appellate court reviews the lower court's application of the law to the facts as presented at the trial.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, however, such as an appeal from a small claims court, the appellate court conducts what is called a \"trial de novo,\" meaning a \"trial from the beginning.\" In those cases, the reviewing court is not bound by the decision of the small claims judge, and new evidence can be presented.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>procedures that apply to appeals</strong> are found in <strong>California Rules of Court</strong>, which may be accessed <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/rules.htm\" target=\"_blank\">clicking here</a>.

See CRC Rule 8.823 (civil) and 8.853 (criminal); CCP 116.750 (small claims).    (In civil cases, Rule 8.823 requires that a notice of appeal be filed either 30 days from when the \"notice of entry\" of the judgment or order is mailed, or 90 days after entry of the judgment or order, whichever is earliest.)\n\n<p>These time limits are \"jurisdictional,\" meaning that the court has no power to allow additional time for filing the notice of appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The Judicial Council has <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm\" target=\"_blank\">forms</a> that can be used for filing a Notice of Appeal from a small claims case (SC-140), a traffic/infraction case (CR-142), and a misdemeanor criminal case (CR-132).  For appeals from limited civil cases (APP-102).</p>\n\n<p>CRC Rule 8.810 and Rule 8.812 authorizes the appellate court to extend the time or relieve a party from default in relation to many of the things required for prosecuting an appeal, but these rules do not allow the court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n\n<a name=\"2\"></a><h3>Appointment of Counsel</h3>\n\n<p>Pursuant to CRC 8.851, any defendant who is convicted of a misdemeanor and subject to incarceration or a fine of more than $500, or who is \"likely to suffer significant adverse collateral consequences as a result of the conviction,\" can apply for appointment of counsel on appeal.  Rule 8.851.

(See Judicial Council form APP-103)\n\n<p>The <strong>\"Clerk's Transcript\"</strong> is a compilation of the documents filed in the lower court.  The notice filed by the appellant within 10 days of filing the notice of appeal designates which records from the trial court file he or she wants submitted to the Appellate Division.  If no specific documents are designated, the clerk of the trial court will prepare the records described in CRC Rule 8.831.  Pursuant to Local Rule 4.2.3 A, the court has elected to use the original trial court documents as the record in lieu of a clerk's transcript. A <strong>\"Reporter's Transcript\"</strong> is a verbatim record of the oral proceedings in the court.  A reporter's transcript is not required for an appeal (since a \"statement on appeal\" can be used where the proceedings were not recorded by a court reporter or can be effectively summarized without a verbatim transcript), but is often requested.  Where the appellant wants to appeal an issue that requires consideration of the oral proceedings (including jury instructions given or refused) he or she must include as part of the designation of records a notice to prepare a reporter's transcript of the oral proceedings.  See Rule 8.834. Pursuant to Local Rule 4.2.3 B, the original of an official electronic recording of the trial court proceedings, or a copy made by the court, may be transmitted as the record of these oral proceedings without being transcribed.</p>\n\n<p>This notice must identify the date of each proceeding to be included in the transcript.  The trial court clerk transmits this notice to the court reporter(s) that was present at the designated proceeding(s), and the court reporter notifies the appellant of the estimated cost of preparing the reporter's transcript.  Within 10 days after notification by the reporter of the cost of the transcript, the appellant must deposit that amount with the clerk.</p>\n\n<p>If the appellant chooses not to request a reporter's transcript and to instead proceed with an \"agreed\" or \"proposed\" statement summarizing the evidence or proceedings on which the appeal is based, he or she can proceed as described in Rules 8.836 or 8.837.</p>\n\n<a name=\"6\"></a><h3>Opening Brief</h3>\n\nOnce the record of the trial court's proceedings has been prepared,  the trial court clerk forwards that record to the Clerk of the Appellate Division for processing.  The Appellate Clerk will notify the parties of the briefing schedule (i.e. the dates by which the appellant's opening brief, the respondent's brief, and the appellant's reply brief, are due) .  Generally Rule 8.882 gives a party appealing to the Superior Court Appellate Division 30 days from when the record on appeal is transmitted to the Appellate Division in which to file an opening brief.\n\n<p>Per Rule 8.883, the opening brief must concisely describe the law and facts relied on by the appellant in claiming that the trial court erred in making the judgment or order being appealed from.   As noted above, function of an appellate court is to review errors of law, not to make factual determinations.  A trial court judgment or order will only be reversed if the court made an erroneous ruling on a legal issue or if there was \"no substantial evidence\" to support the judgment.  The opening brief must explain the legal basis for asking the appellate court to reverse the trial court's judgment or order, with specific reference to the parts of the record and case law or statute supporting each argument made in the appeal.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"7\"></a><h3>Abandonment or Dismissal</h3>\n\n<p>After the filing of the record with the Appellate Division, the appellant can ask the court to dismiss the appeal by filing a written request under CRC Rule 8.825 (in limited civil cases),  Rule 8.855 (in misdemeanor), or Rule 8.904 (in infraction cases).  If the appellant fails to file an opening brief by the date allowed in the briefing schedule, or otherwise fails to prosecute it diligently or to comply with applicable rules, the court, on motion by the respondent or on its own motion, can, after notice to the appellant, dismiss the appeal.  Rule 8.963.\n\n  </p>\n\n<a name=\"8\"></a>\n\n<h3>Fees/Costs</h3>\n\n<p>There is no fee for filing an appeal from a criminal case (including misdemeanors or infractions), except for the cost of  Reporter's Transcript.  In criminal cases, this cost can be waived if the appellant is indigent and if the court finds that a verbatim transcript is \"necessary\" to the appeal and no alternative means of providing a record of the lower court proceedings is adequate.</p>\n\n<p>In limited civil cases, the fee for filing a notice of appeal is $200 if the complaint was for an amount $10,000 or less and $325 if the complaint was for over $10,000.  In addition, there will be a charge for preparation of a Reporter's Transcript if one is requested, and for preparation of the Clerk's Transcript if a valid fee waiver order is not on file.  In addition, the prevailing party in an appeal is generally entitled to recover his or her costs, and if the court finds that the appeal was frivolous, he or she may also be subject to monetary sanctions.  See Rule 8.891.</p>\n\n<a name=\"9\"></a><h3>Other Resources</h3>\n\nRules of court, statutes, case law and other materials that may be useful to understanding the procedures for prosecuting or defending an appeal, are available at the Fresno County law library on the 6th Floor of the Downtown Courthouse.

The use of State Certified and State Registered Interpreters are provided to assist the non-English party in their court proceeding.  However, due to a shortage of certified/registered interpreters statewide the court may provide a provisionally qualified interpreter (non-certified, non-registered).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, through a grant provided by the Judicial Council, Administrative Office of the Courts, we are currently providing interpreters for indigent litigants in family law cases where a Domestic Violence restraining order was sought or issued.</p>\n<p>If you are involved in a proceeding for a criminal, traffic, juvenile, or domestic violence matter, you may ask the clerk at the counter or the clerk in the courtroom for an interpreter. If an interpreter is not available at the time of your hearing, the Court may continue your case until an interpreter can be assigned.</p>\n<p>If you need an interpreter in any language other than Spanish, you should notify the court as soon as possible as to your language need. If you wait until your court date, you may have to wait until an interpreter can be contacted, or your matter may be continued to a future date.</p>\n<p>For information on obtaining an interpreter, please contact the Interpreters' Office at (559) 457-4910.</p>\n<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2>\nIf you require the services of a sign language interpreter, you may request one at any facility, for any type of hearing you may have. This includes civil hearings, small claims hearings and jury duty.  For further information on this and other Access and Accommodation needs please visit the <a href=\"/general_info/ada.php\">ADA page</a> of this site.\n<!--<p>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n<h2>Volunteer Interpreter Bureau</h2>\nFresno Superior Court is proud to offer (based upon availability) volunteer interpreters to assist self-represented litigants in civil cases.  The Volunteer Interpreter Bureau is made up of volunteers drawn from community agencies, as well as educational institutions that assist self-represented litigants with translations at the Center or in Court.  The volunteer interpreters are tested by the court\ufffds Interpreter Department Manager and placed according to their skill level.  Certified court interpreters mentor those who are selected for use in the courtroom until they are ready to assist litigants on their own.  Most of the volunteers aspire to become certified court interpreters and their ability to assist as a volunteer enables them to strengthen their skills in preparation of the State exam.\n<p><strong>If you are fluent in English and Spanish - Become a Volunteer Interpreter through the Centro De Recursos Legales (Spanish Self-Help Center)</strong></p>\n<p>As a Volunteer Interpreter you can:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Help our Spanish-speaking community gain equal access to our Court system.</li>\n\t<li>Explore interpreting as a career.</li>\n\t<li>Be mentored by a Certified Court Interpreter and gain first-hand experience in the exciting world of interpreting.</li>\n\t<li>Be a part of helping others help themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you are interested in becoming a Volunteer, call (559) 497-7820</strong></p>\n-->\n<p>If you are interested in becoming a Certified Interpreter, visit <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/7996.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AOC's Becoming an Interpreter home page</a>.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Filing Dates</h3>\nOnce a holding order has been filed in a felony case, pretrial motions normally should not be filed prior to arraignment. (See, e.g., Local Rule 18.1.)\n<p>All motions need to be properly filed and served. Unless otherwise ordered or specified by law, generally pretrial criminal motions must be filed and served at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing date.  Opposition papers are due at least five calendar days prior to the hearing and reply papers are due at least two court days prior to that hearing.  (CRC rule 4.111(a).)</p>\n<p>There are exceptions. For example, one of the motions to suppress evidence requires service at least 10 court days prior to the hearing.  (Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5(i).)  Pitchess discovery motions must comply with the same extended filing requirements that exist for civil motions.  (Evidence Code \u00a7 1043(a).)  Motions to continue a hearing or trial normally require two-court-days notice.  (Penal Code \u00a7 1050(b).)  The moving party is responsible for verifying the exact filing requirements for her or her particular motion.</p>\n<p>If a shorter notice/filing period is desired, the attorney of record should obtain court permission, by way of an order shortening time, prior to submitting the proposed motion to the court clerk.</p>\n<h3>Post-Dated Motions</h3>\nOccasionally the moving party will attempt to set a pretrial motion to be heard after existing trial date. The judges of this court have instructed the court clerks not to accept such motions for filing without prior judicial authorization, even if the proponent feels confident that the trial date will ultimately be continued.  It is the court, not the parties, that controls trial dates.  (Cf. Local Rule 18.1.)\n<h3>Motion Content</h3>\nPapers must comply with the applicable rules of court. For example, motions that are not support with points and authorities may be deemed to be without merit.  (CRC rule 4.111(b).)  Only originals with original signatures will be accepted for filing.  It is recommended that a copy be provided for the court's use.  If the party wants a returned conformed copy, then a second copy should be provided for that purpose.\n<p>Motions filed personally by an inmate need to include a complete return address, including the inmate's jail or prison identification number.</p>\n<h3>Who May File?</h3>\nGenerally, documents may be filed only through the attorney of record. Without prior court authorization, a defendant who is represented by counsel is usually limited to filing motions related to his or her representation, such as Faretta or Marsden motions.  Any other \"pro per\" motions submitted by a represented defendant normally will be returned unfiled by the court.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Ex Parte Motions</h3>\nEx parte criminal motions normally should comply with the same rules that exist for ex parte civil matters. (See CRC rule 379.)\n<h3>Appeals</h3>\nA felony defendant who seeks to appeal his or her conviction must file a timely notice of appeal with the superior court. (See, e.g., CRC rules 30 and 30.1.)  Additional requirements may exist when the conviction was based on a plea agreement.  (See, for example, Penal Code \u00a7 1237.5.)  Thereafter, the superior court will automatically generate the basic appellate documentation.  (See rule 31 et seq.)\n<h3>Habeas Corpus Petitions</h3>\nHabeas corpus petitions should comply with Local Rule 14.7 and CRC rule 4.550 et seq.  Petitions prepared by self-represented individuals should be submitted on approved Judicial Council form MC-275. (See CRC rule 4.551(a).)  Such petitions need to contain adequate objective supporting documentation and, when applicable, should affirm that existing legal and administrative options have been fully exhausted.\n<p>Habeas corpus relief normally does not apply to issues that either were or could have been resolved by way of a timely appeal.  The filing of multiple unmeritorious petitions may be viewed as abuse of the writ process.  (See, e.g., In re Robbins (1998) 18 Cal.4th 770, In re Harris (1993) 5 Cal.4th 813, and In re Clark (1993) 5 Cal.4th 750.)</p>\n<p>As with motions, the petitioner must provide a signed original for filing. Inmate-generated petitions must contain the petitioner's complete return address including the inmate identification number.</p>\n<h3>Mandate (Mandamus) and Prohibition Petitions</h3>\nWrits of mandate and prohibition are directed from a higher court to an inferior court or body. Except as otherwise provided by law, the superior court should not be asked to issue one of these writs to itself.  (Cf. CCP \u00a7\u00a7 1085(b) and 1003(b), which authorize the appellate division of the superior court to issue such writs in limited civil cases or in misdemeanor and infraction cases.)\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\t\t\t<!-- END BODY -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr></table>", "parent": "http://www.fresno.courts.ca.gov/criminal/"},

Criminal code section 273.5 requires criminal penalties including jail or prison and participation in a 52 week batterer's treatment program.  To meet the criteria for arrest under 273.5 the partners must be married, living together, or have a child in common and the victim must have visible injuries.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>There is also a civil code section under the Domestic Violence Protection Act. This civil code protects partners who are in dating relationships or same sex relationships.  In some cases, no visible injuries have to be observed by an officer to warrant an arrest.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/_images/dv_power_control.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p>Domestic Violence is about power and control over another person.  It is not a problem with anger.  Rarely do you see an abuser act violently with friends, coworkers or a boss.  It is a Jeckyl and Hyde personality that confuses others who learn of a person's violence with their partners.  Abusers can act charming, loving and attentive...when they want to.  Drinking, drugs, genetics, the victim's behavior or stress does not cause domestic violence.  It is learned behavior. It is learned in the home by observation and reinforcement before the age of 10.  Domestic Violence happens in all races, religions and socio-economic groups.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>An abusive relationship is not abusive at all times.

Over time, tension starts building. Usually when the abuser feels that the victim is sufficiently \"hooked\" into the relationship, either through marriage, moving in together or getting pregnant, the abuse starts.  The honeymoon phase is what \"hooks\" the victim back into the relationship and keeps the cycle moving.  Over time the cycle reduces to just tension/abuse and the episodes of violence get more frequent and severe.</p>\n<h3>Characteristics of Victims</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Found in all socio-economic, educational, racial and age groups.</li>\n\t<li>Many battered women report violence in family of origin.</li>\n\t<li>Many report marrying young to escape violent homes.</li>\n\t<li>Many, but not all, witnessed some form of abuse as children.</li>\n\t<li>Low self-esteem.

This act was passed to protect victims of domestic violence.\n<p>A person is eligible for a restraining order, which can last up to three years if they had a relationship with their abuser that fits one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Relative</li>\n\t<li>Relative by marriage</li>\n\t<li>Dating</li>\n\t<li>Living together</li>\n\t<li>Children in common</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A victim can obtain an order which prevents the abuser from contacting the abused party by any means including physical contact, physical violence, threats, third party contacts, telephone calls and harassment.  The victim can also protect members of their household and immediate family from abuse by adding them to the order.</p>\n<p>The victim can obtain a stay away order which prevents the abuser from coming within 100 yards from the victim and other protected parties.  The victim can also obtain an order allowing them to remain in their home pending further court action, or keep property such as a car, which allows the victim to care for their children or get to work.  The victim can also obtain child custody and child support orders with the order.</p>\n<p>Forms can be picked up from the Fresno County Superior Court (1100 Van Ness between Fresno and Tulare) fourth floor, Family Law Facilitator's Office (255 N.

When a parent has physical custody over a child, it means the child would spend time living with that parent on a regular basis.  If the parents have joint physical custody the child lives at each parent's home.  However, if one parent has sole physical custody, the child spends significantly less time at the other parent's house.\n\n<p>If a parent has sole legal custody of a child, it means that he or she has the right to make decisions regarding the child's health, education and welfare, such as what school or doctor shall be used.  Joint legal custody means both parents share the decisions.</p>\n<p>If parents agree on a custody plan, the judge will usually approve it.  If the parents cannot agree on a custody plan, they will have to speak with a mediator or counselor who will help them work out a plan.  The judge will decide any disputed issues that parents are unable to resolve during mediation.</p>\n<h4>What Is Mediation?</h4>\nIt is a process of dispute resolution.  California law mandates Mediation in every case where custody or visitation is contested.  The purpose of Mediation is to reduce the conflict and to develop an agreement assuring the children's close and continuing contact with both parents after the separation.  The mediator is appointed by the court and must meet various educational qualifications prescribed by law.\n\n<p>If the two parents cannot reach an agreement as to custody and visitation, the mediator may make suggestions to the court as to a temporary disposition pending a full trial.  Mediation is not an adversary proceeding.  When a decision must be made, the court will make the decision, not the mediator.</p>\n<p>The reason for Mediation is to help parents share the rights and responsibilities in such a way that the best interests of the child will not be jeopardized.  Mediation helps parents to focus on the needs of the children.</p>\n\n<h3>Domestic Violence and Immigration Status</h3>\nIf someone is a victim of domestic violence and his or her legal status in the United States is tied to the abuser, it is important to know:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Some victims will not leave the abuser because they fear being deported.  The threat of deportation is real, however the victim's safety is the primary issue.</li>\n\t<li>A victim of domestic violence is entitled to receive emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</li>\n\t<li>A crime victim is not required to give his/her immigration status to the police.</li>\n\t<li>It is important to speak to a lawyer because many things can change the legal citizenship status of the abused victim.  His/her situation could change through divorce or separation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Violence Against Women Act</h4>\nUnder the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the spouses and children of United States citizens or lawful permanent residents may self-petition to obtain lawful permanent residency.

Self-petitions are filed with the Vermont Service Center and should be sent by certified return receipt mail (or any other method providing assurance of receipt).

The following information was developed by Barbara J. Hart, Esq. In Assessing Whether Batterer's Will Kill.  The assessment looks at a number of predictors.  The underlying assumption is the higher the number of predictors, the higher the potential for the batterer to commit a homicide or engage in potentially lethal behaviors.\n\n<p>Predictors of Lethality Include:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Threats of suicide or homicide including killing himself, the victim, children or relatives.</li>\n\t<li>Fantasies of homicide or suicide in the guise of fantasizing \"who, how, when and/or where to kill.\"</li>\n\t<li>Weapons owned by the perpetrator who has threatened to used them or has used them in the past (the use of guns is a strong predictor of homicide).</li>\n\t<li>Feelings of \"ownership\" of the victim.</li>\n\t<li>\"Centrality\" to the victim (idolizing and extreme dependence).</li>\n\t<li>Separation from the victim (this is an extremely dangerous time when perpetrators make the decision to kill).</li>\n\t<li>Dangerous behavior increases in degree with little regard for legal or social consequences.</li>\n\t<li>Hostage-taking</li>\n\t<li>Depression</li>\n\t<li>Repeated calls to the police.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lethality assessments are more an art than a science and cannot be considered precise by any means.  They are not a tool for certain prediction, but rather one for risk assessment and safety planning or intervention.  Social service providers should error on the side of caution and inform their clients that any abuser can potentially be lethal.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>How to Obtain Replacement Documents</h3>\n<h4>Birth Certificates</h4>\nTo obtain a copy of your birth certificate or the birth certificates of your children, contact the Fresno County Hall of Records, or the county clerk in the county and state where you were born.

In the context of domestic violence, a mandated reporter must consider whether there is a risk of physical or emotional harm to the child.  The fact that a child's parent or guardian has been the victim of domestic violence is not in and of itself a sufficient basis for reporting suspected child abuse or neglect.  Further, a child's exposure to a domestic violence incident in and of itself is not a sufficient basis for reporting.  Other factors must exist which lead the mandated reporter to reasonably suspect that the child's physical or emotional health is endangered as the result of domestic violence.  A mandated reporter must report suspected child abuse or neglect to Child Protective Services in the following domestic violence cases:\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A domestic violence incident which caused physical injury to the child or created a serious risk of injury to the child.</strong></p>\n<p>Factors to consider in determining whether a domestic violence incident created serious risk of physical injury include:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Were objects thrown or broken in the presence of the child?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator threaten to harm the child?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator strike a victim who was holding a child?</li>\n\t<li>Did the child physically intervene in the violence?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator threaten to murder or commit suicide?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator threaten the victim with a gun, knife or weapon?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator choke or strangle the victim?</li>\n\t<li>Did the perpetrator hurt the family pet?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A domestic violence incident which caused serious emotional damage to the child or created a substantial risk of serious damage to the child.</strong></p>\n<p>Serious emotional damage in the context of child protection law means the child exhibits severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and aggressive behavior toward self or others as a result of the conduct of a parent.  Further, a report should also be made if the victim is incapable of providing for the child's treatment or care for the emotional damage caused by domestic violence or is unable to protect the child from repeated exposure to domestic violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Mandating Reporting of Domestic Violence</h4>\nOnly certain occupations are considered mandated to report domestic violence.  Any health practitioner employed in a health facility, clinic, physician's office, local or state public health department who, within the scope of their employment provides medical services for a physical condition to a patient of whom they know or reasonably suspects of being a victim of domestic violence must report to the local law enforcement agency.\n\n<p>If you are a health practitioner and are aware of a domestic violence situation, a report by telephone is to be made immediately or as soon as practically possible.  Additionally, a written report must be prepared on the standard form and sent to the local law enforcement agency within 2 days.</p>\n<h4>Domestic Violence and the Workplace</h4>\nCalifornia Labor code provides guaranteed time off from work for victims of domestic violence to go to court or obtain services.  These laws known collectively as the \"Victims of Domestic Violence Leave Act\" were enacted to address the impact of domestic violence on the workplace.  These laws prohibit employers from discriminating or retaliating against domestic violence victims who take time off from work to seek judicial remedies, such as restraining orders, domestic violence related services such as medical or psychological counseling or escaping to a shelter program.\n<p>Steps for Supervisors and Co-Workers to Respond to Domestic Violence in the Workplace</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p><strong>Don'ts</strong></p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Don't tell the victim what they should do.</li>\n\t\t<li>Don't ask the victim what they did to deserve the abuse.</li>\n\t\t<li>Don't ask the victim what is wrong with them.</li>\n\t\t<li>Don't ask why they stay.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p><strong>Do's if the Victim is not Talking About The Abuse</strong></p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Tell them you are concerned.</li>\n\t\t<li>Ask the victim if everything is all right.</li>\n\t\t<li>Give the victim an unmarked or marked card with a 24-hour crisis number.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p><strong>Do's if The Victim is Talking About The Abuse</strong></p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Be a good listener.

Unless excused by the Court, both parties are  required to complete a Family Court Services (FCS) Orientation program prior to  their scheduled FCS appointment. Failing to successfully complete Orientation  may result in adverse consequences from the Court. The orientation prepares  parties for their Tier 1 \u2013 Confidential Mediation by giving an overview of the  process. This includes educational information regarding children's  developmental needs and co-parenting skills.</p>\n<p>The FCS Orientation is  provided in both English and Spanish.\u00a0 You  can view the complete FCS slide show Orientation\u00a0<strong>Online\u00a0</strong>here  in:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a

orders the parties to participate in Tier 1 \u2013 Confidential Mediation on more than one occasion, the Court may again order the parties to complete the FCS orientation in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>If the parties have failed to complete the  orientation as previously ordered by the Court, or</li>\n  <li>If it has been more than 6 months since the  parties last

should be informed in advance, if  possible, of any unusual legal issues or evidentiary matters that are  anticipated during the trial in order to avoid unnecessary delays.\u00a0 </li>\n    <li>Bench

Rules of Court, rule 7.950(3)</strong>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Must the Petition include as an attachment a doctor\ufffds note?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it is essential that the Petition include an original or a photocopy of a doctor\ufffds report containing a diagnosis of and prognosis for the injury, and a report of the claimant's present condition (<strong>Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950(4)</strong>.)</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>What if the minor\ufffds injury occurred several years ago? Is it necessary to provide a current physician\ufffds note?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, CRC 7.950 (4) requires that the Petition include a report of the minor\ufffds PRESENT CONDITION. If the minor suffered serious injuries in January 2002 and the Petition only includes a medical report from January 2002, then the court cannot verify the minor\ufffds PRESENT CONDITION unless the Petition includes a CURRENT physician\ufffds note.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if the minor suffered different kinds of injuries? Is more than one physician\ufffds note required?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. If, for example, the minor suffered head injuries with possible brain damage and also sustained facial lacerations which have left some scarring, then the Petition should normally include one note from a physician qualified to evaluate head trauma and brain function as well as a separate note from a plastic surgeon qualified to evaluate the cost and feasibility of scar revision through surgery or other methods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How and where can the minor\ufffds settlement monies be invested?</strong></p>\n\n<p>California statutes place certain restrictions on disposition of the settlement monies to be paid to the minor.  The court is authorized by statute to order the money held under such conditions as the court in its discretion determines to be in the best interests of the minor.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, pursuant to statute, the money is deposited into an INSURED account in a financial institution IN THIS STATE, or in a single-premium deferred ANNUITY, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.  (See Probate Code, \ufffd\ufffd 3412, 3413, 3500, 3611.)</p>\n\n<p>If an annuity is selected, the Petitioner should submit a statement disclosing the schedule of payouts the minor will receive and the Petitioner should also submit evidence of the insurance ratings of the insurer which will be paying the annuity, so that the court may verify the insurer\ufffds solvency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Must the Petitioner and the attorney who assisted Petitioner sign the Petition?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. CRC 7.950 requires that the Petition be verified. The Judicial Council form MC-350 Petition includes signature lines for both the Petitioner and counsel. It is a very common error for Petitioner and/or counsel to forget to sign the Petition.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p><strong>Must the Petitioner obtain a hearing date for the minor\ufffds compromise?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will a tentative ruling be posted on the court\ufffds website?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.

Each morning trial will commence at 8:30 for counsel and 9:00 for jurors. A lunch break will be taken at 12:00. The afternoon session will commence at 1:30. Evening recess will generally be taken at 3:15, depending on the court\u2019s other calendars and the progress of the trial. All days and times are subject to change and the court will endeavor to provide ample notice of any changes. Counsel are expected to be punctual and ready to proceed on time.</li>\n<li><strong>Trial Time Estimates.</strong> At the outset of the pretrial conference, in order to facilitate an  accurate time estimate for the jury venire, the parties must file a Joint  Statement re Trial Time Estimates (or separate statements if unable to agree), setting forth:</li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\t  <li>A witness list with the name of each witness to be called on direct and the number of hours of direct examination that will be required for each witness, and</li>\n\t  <li>The total number of hours of cross-examination and re-direct examination contemplated for each witness.</li>\n</ol>\n<li><strong>Exhibits.</strong><br>\n<ul>    <li>At the outset of the pretrial conference, all exhibits must be exchanged between counsel and submitted to the clerk.</li>\n    <li>Exhibits should be pre-marked in the anticipated order of presentation.</li>\n    <li>All exhibits, regardless of who marks them, shall be marked in numerical order.</li>\n    <li>Multiple page exhibits must be separately bound or included under a separate tab in a binder and each page must be separately numbered.</li>\n    <li>The court does not separate, nor receive into evidence, part of an exhibit.  For example, if Exhibit 1 has 50 pages, the court will not entertain a motion to receive into evidence page 27 of that exhibit.  Preplanning should and does prevent most of these circumstances.  However, should counsel find that they are in the above situation, they should have 5 extra copies of \u201cpage 27\u201d ready, which will be presented to the clerk and offered as the \u201cnext in order.\u201d</li>\n\t<li>Duplicate sets of exhibits must be prepared for each counsel, the court, the clerk and the witness.</li>\n    <li>Photographs shall be Bates-stamped, presented in clear slip-covers or 3-hole punched so that they may be placed in an exhibit binder.</li>\n    <li>Counsel must jointly prepare a single exhibit list which accurately describes each exhibit submitted to the clerk.</li>\n    <li>To the extent possible, counsel must meet and confer before trial to agree upon foundational issues.</li> \n\t<li>Counsel may not show an exhibit to a witness for any purpose unless and until it has been marked for identification.</li>\n    <li>Absent a stipulation or permission of the court, counsel may not display any exhibit to the jury unless it has first been received into evidence.</li>  </ul>\n  </li><li><strong>Witness Lists.</strong> At the outset of the pretrial conference, counsel must provide to the court a jointly prepared list of prospective witnesses in an electronic format suitable for the court to manipulate for eventual publication to the jury panel during voir dire.\n\t  \n  </li><li><strong>Witness Scheduling.</strong> Counsel has full responsibility to arrange for the appearance of witnesses during the presentation of their case so as to eliminate any possible delay in the proceedings. The court strongly encourages counsel to confer during trial as to when witnesses are needed. Counsel are expected to inform the court immediately upon discovering a problem with scheduling that might delay the trial so that arrangements can be made for the appearance of other witnesses out of order. If counsel does not comply with this procedure and there are no witnesses available to testify it is equivalent to resting. Counsel are required to inform each other at the end of the trial day who their witnesses will be for the following day.\n</li><li><strong>Unusual Legal Issues or Evidentiary Matters.</strong> The court should be informed in advance, if possible, of any unusual legal issues or evidentiary matters that are anticipated during the trial in order to avoid any unnecessary delays for the jury. Unusual evidentiary matters include, but are not limited to, any question about prior criminal activity. All such matters must be raised outside the presence of the jury before being asked in the jury\u2019s presence.</li>\n<li><strong>Factual Stipulations. </strong>Counsel should meet and confer as to all possible factual stipulations on uncontroverted matters.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Jury Selection. </strong></li>\n\t  </ol><ul><li>21 prospective jurors will be seated for voir dire. Voir dire has specific and limited purposes. CCP \u00a7222.5 will be strictly enforced with or without objection. Among other things, \u00a7222.5 provides: \u201cFor purposes of this section, an \u2018improper question\u2019 is any question which, as its dominant purpose, attempts to precondition the prospective jurors to a particular result, indoctrinate the jury, or question the prospective jurors concerning the pleadings or the applicable law.\u201d If you believe you have a cause challenge, the response to the court\u2019s question of \u201cpass for cause?\u201d is simply \u201cno.\u201d Challenges for cause will be expressed in the anteroom behind the courtroom after all counsel have completed questioning.</li>\n\t  <li>Hardships are not entertained in open court before the jury panel.  At the commencement of voir dire, the court will inquire if any among the panel believe they have a hardship.  Any potential juror who so believes will be examined by the court individually and on the record in the court\u2019s anteroom.</li>\t</ul>\n<li><strong>Alternate Juror(s). </strong>Absent an objection stated on the record, the court will seat any required alternate juror(s) and identify them as such at random immediately before the jury retires for deliberation</li>\n<li><strong>Well Access. </strong>After first approaching a witness with permission, counsel may subsequently walk through the well and approach witnesses without permission if a need to approach is presented (e.g., assisting a witness with a document, etc.). Counsel is not allowed to linger in the well while questioning.</li>\n<li><strong>Objections. </strong>Speaking objections or argument regarding objections are not permitted unless invited by the court. State the legal objection only. Counsel must never suggest to any witness, with a speech appended to an objection, what the witness should say or has forgotten to say.</li>\n<li><strong>Jury Instructions and Verdict Forms.  </strong>Jury instructions and verdict forms must be submitted before the first witness is called. Counsel must meet and confer and submit a packet of all requested instructions to which there is no objection and a separate packet of instructions as to which there are objections. If objections are made to any jury instructions on other than relevancy grounds, the objecting party must also submit an instruction that is believed to be non-objectionable. Each instruction must indicate the party or parties requesting it, all blanks must be filled in and any irrelevant portions redacted.</li>\n<li><strong>Recess Recitals and Admonitions.  </strong>Unless the court states otherwise on the record, it will be assumed that counsel agree to the following: </li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\t  <li>Whenever the court is in session, all jurors, alternates and counsel are present; and</li>\n\t  <li>Waiving the statutory language of the admonition to the jury at separation (CCP \u00a7611) so that after the court gives the required admonition at the outset of the trial, it need not at each subsequent recess or adjournment repeat or remind the jury of this admonition.</li>\n</ol>\t\n<li><strong>Lodging Deposition Transcripts. </strong>Before reading from any deposition transcript, counsel must lodge with the clerk the original of the deposition transcript to be read from.</li>\n<li><strong>Reading Deposition Testimony. </strong>If portions of deposition transcripts are anticipated to be read to the jury, counsel are expected to meet and confer in advance regarding any objections that will be offered to any such testimony so as not to take up the time of the jury. If objections to any of the testimony are raised, they must be addressed outside of the presence of the jury. No reading from deposition transcripts (even for the purpose of impeachment) is permitted without reasonable advance notice of each page and line reference to the court and other counsel.</li>\n<li><strong>Mini-Openings or Statement of the Case.  </strong>The court prefers that each counsel delivers a brief mini-opening of the case at the time they introduce themselves and their client(s) to the jury panel. In the alternative, at the outset of the pretrial conference counsel must submit to the court a short, jointly prepared and neutral statement of the case for reading to the jury panel during jury selection.</li>\n<li><strong>Court Reporter.  </strong>The parties are responsible for arranging for and paying for a court reporter in the event a court reporter is desired. See the Fresno County Superior Court website for information on securing a court reporter for trial.</li>\n<li><strong>Court Fees. </strong>All court fees, including jury fees and mileage, must be paid before the jury is sworn.</li>\n<li><strong>Cumulative Questioning. </strong>Questions like these are generally not permitted: \u201cDidn\u2019t you testify yesterday that . . .?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you just testify that . . .?\u201d, \u201cWere you in court when John Doe testified that . . .?\u201d The jury has already heard what the witness testified to and, thus, these questions are cumulative and unnecessarily consumptive of time. The court may intervene even without objection if such questions are asked.</li>\n<li><strong>Sidebars. </strong><em>Bench conferences are generally not permitted and hallway conferences are strongly discouraged. </em>No record is made of such conferences unless counsel timely requests it.</li>\n<li><strong>Stipulations. </strong>While the court always appreciates stipulations as to admissibility of exhibits or other evidence, stipulations should never be offered by counsel in the presence of the jury unless counsel has previously discussed the stipulation with counsel and the court outside of the jury\u2019s presence.</li>\n<li><strong>Settlement. </strong>The court is always willing to assist with settlement if the parties collectively agree and can do so without subjecting the jury to unnecessary delay.</li>\n\n\t\t\t<!-- END BODY -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr></table>", "parent": "http://www.fresno.courts.ca.gov/civil/general_trial_procedures/"},

A minimum deposit of $1,000.00 will be required to open a fax filing account for payment of filing fees and transmittal costs. A minimum deposit of $100.00 may be accepted for transmittal fees only.

However, to Local Rule 4.1.6, fax filings in criminal and traffic cases are exempt from the filing fee requirements.

Kleps Award</h2>\n\nThe self-represented Spanish litigant is confronted with a lack of understanding of court procedures, as well as the inability to communicate effectively with court staff.  Of these obstacles, language barrier is the most dominant hindrance to justice.  \n\n<p>In a report published by Scott Houser, Ph.D., research associate at the Institute for Research on Poverty and a consultant to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it indicated that Fresno had undergone tremendous population growth in terms of the Hispanic population between 1990 and 2000, which now comprise 44 percent of the total population in the County.  What is extraordinary is the rate at which the Hispanic population grew, a significant 48.6 percent, while non-Hispanic whites declined for the same period.  Even more significant is the ethnicity breakdown in the rural communities within Fresno County where, depending on the city, 65 to 98 percent of the population are Hispanic.  Consistent with these figures is data from Dr. Houser's report that shows 75 percent of 18-64 year olds who speak a language other than English, speak Spanish in the home.</p>\n\n<p>These statistics clearly demonstrated there was a large Spanish population whose access to the Court system was hindered by a language barrier.  Therefore, the Court proposed a model that would break through the barrier by offering:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li><strong>Educational information and language assistance</strong> to the Spanish pro per litigant by means of developing simple self-help instructions (translated into Spanish) for most commonly used court forms. The challenge of completing court documents is daunting enough for an English-speaking litigant and is even further complicated when one has limited English proficiency.  Simple self-help instructions were not available in English, let alone in Spanish.  A common complaint by all pro per litigants is that court forms are cumbersome, difficult to understand, and are not user friendly.  This component addressed the language needs of the Spanish pro per litigant by developing clear and simple written self-help instructions (translated into Spanish) for commonly used Family Law, Unlawful Detainer, Civil Harassment and Guardianship court forms.<br><br></li>\n\n\t\n\n\t<li>Collaboration with Community organizations to form a <strong>Spanish Community Volunteer Interpreter Bureau</strong> that would provide Spanish pro per litigants with interpreters in civil cases. Providing clear and simple self-help instructions in Spanish is a start, but it is not enough.  This project went further in breaking down the language barrier by providing the Spanish pro per litigant with language assistance through a Spanish Community Volunteer Interpreter Bureau.  Formulating a team of qualified volunteer interpreters was key to the success of this project.  The Community Resource Manager's primary responsibility was to coordinate with locally based organizations to form a network of Spanish speaking volunteers to provide language assistance.  The process entailed forming a Community Advisory Committee made up of ten community leaders involved in the Hispanic community, two Judges, Court Executive Officer and five court staff.  Input from the committee guided the staff, which led to recruitment and training of volunteers to serve either at the Center or in court.  Volunteer Interpreters become a part of our Interpreter Development program wherein they are first tested to place them according to their skill level. Next, they are mentored by certified court interpreters, which include shadowing certified interpreters at court hearings.  This gives the volunteers a leg up in the real world of court interpreting.  Obviously it has been effective as 6 of 9 participants in the courts first Interpreter Mentor Program passed the written State Certification Examination for Court Interpreters.  Most of the volunteers are working to become certified court interpreters and their ability to assist as a volunteer enables them to strengthen their skills in preparation for the State exam and as the recent success rate indicates, it is proving to do just that.<br><br></li>\n\n\t\n\n\t<li>Location and <strong>Services provided at Centro de Recursos Legales</strong><br>\n\n\tThe centerpiece of this project is a self-help center named, Centro de Recursos Legales, designed specifically for the under-served Spanish population in Fresno County.  The Center provides pro per litigants with education, user satisfaction, and access to the court in an efficient and effective manner by offering information in Family Law, Unlawful Detainer, Civil Harassment, and Guardianship areas of law.\n\n\t<p>The Center is located at 255 N. Fulton, adjacent to the Family Law Facilitator Office, and provides pro per litigants with education and access to the Court in an efficient and effective manner by offering the following services:</p>\n\n\t</li>\n\n\t</ol><ul>\n\n\t\t<li>Daily access to Spanish language self-help instructions.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Interpreter assistance provided through a Spanish Community Volunteer Interpreter Bureau.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Review of court documents by a Court Examiner.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Access to clinics with rotating \"how-to\" lectures in Spanish on Guardianship, Unlawful Detainer, Civil Harassment and Family Law.</li>\n\n\t</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h3>Impact on the Court and the Public</h3>\n\nThe Center is located away from the main courthouse, in a separate facility to allow for more personalized service.   It opened to the public in the last week of January 2003 where we assisted 28 litigants.  However, as news of the Center spread throughout the community the number of litigants served started to increase significantly over the next few months.  During the month of February we assisted 124, March 197, and in April 169.  These statistics clearly validate the need for the court to provide services to the under-served Spanish pro per litigant.  The Center serves on average 163 Spanish speaking pro per litigants each month.\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhancing Judicial Efficiency and Effectiveness</h3>\n\nCentro de Recursos Legales enhances judicial efficiency and effectiveness through several components.  By making available to Spanish speaking litigants simple self-help instructions, they in turn are able to provide the necessary information required on court forms.  Also, we have provided the Facilitators office, which is next door to the Center, with these instructions.  If however, a Spanish client needs further assistance, they are referred to the Center.  Furthermore, having the paperwork reviewed by a court examiner ensures accuracy when the papers are filed, thus reducing the number of errors that often occur in pro per cases.  Lastly, judicial efficiency is furthered through the use of volunteer interpreters who assist at the Center and in court allowing the court process to take place with little interruption and/or continuance.\n\n\n\n<p>For additional information <strong>contact: Michelle Jorgensen, Facilitator at (559) 457-2103</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"kkis\"></a><h2>Keep Kids In School (KKIS)</h2>\n\n<h3>Winner of a 2001 ralph N. Kleps Award</h3>\n\nFresno County's Keep Kids In School program, also known as <strong>KKIS</strong>, is an aggressive early intervention program that targets truant youth who, by definition, are more likely to drop out of school.  Truancy has become a strong indicator of youth tendencies toward drug use and violent behavior.  When kids start missing school, they are sending a strong message to the community that they are in trouble and need help if they are to prosper and succeed in life.  Proacting to truancy is one of the first ways a community can reach out quickly to a family in trouble.  Since the problem of chronic truancy is not just a school issue or a court issue, but a community issue, the program leverages the expertise and support of: the Fresno County Superior Court, Fresno County Volunteer Bureau, the District Attorney's Office, the Probation Department, attorneys willing to provide pro bono services, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Comprehensive Youth Services, Target Stores, and St. Agnes Medical Center's Footsteps program.  This, combined with enforcement and accountability, has made KKIS a unique and powerful program for combating school truancy and keeping schools safer.\n\n<p>The Keep Kids in School Program (KKIS) is a multi-agency approach designed to deal more effectively with the truancy problem in Fresno County.  The primary goal of the program is to improve the school and academic performance of children at both the elementary and middle school level.  Poor school attendance frequently is a symptom of a dysfunctional family structure.  Accordingly, the program seeks to identify these at-risk families and provide appropriate intervention to address parental ineffectiveness and/or neglect thereby increasing school attendance.  The program is designed to reduce the risk the child will become involved in the criminal justice system by improving school attendance.</p>\n\n<p>KKIS has two primary components: the first involves intervention at the elementary school level; the second involves intervention at the secondary school level with middle school students ages 12-14.  The program weaves together the following themes: parental involvement, accountability, and responsibility; community involvement and support; enforcement of laws regarding school attendance; and self-empowerment.  An array of support services is provided to at-risk families.  If the child's school attendance fails to improve despite the provision of appropriate services, charges may be filed against the parent and where appropriate, the child.  Consequences to the parent include not only a fine, but also the possibility of incarceration.</p>\n\n<p>The KKIS program is designed to reduce the risk that the child will become involved in the criminal justice system by improving school attendance.  KKIS has also been instrumental in demonstrating the powerful impact of the Court in a proactive role.  KKIS has been the vehicle to hold both child and parent accountable for behavior by leveraging both the legal code as well as the education code.  The visibility of the courts in the KKIS program anchored to California's fourth largest school district has been the primary catalyst for intensive interagency collaboration.  As a result of the Court's leadership, KKIS is a self-sustaining program.  Financial gains achieved through improved average daily attendance are reinvested back into the program, thus contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.</p>\n\n<p>KKIS is an early intervention program.  The problem of chronic truancy is not just a school issue or a court issue, but a community issue.  Therefore, the approach to dealing with truancy cannot be accomplished through a single agency or entity task.  Such a limited approach will not solve the issues of which truancy is a symptom; and it will not prevent the delinquency of which truancy is an indicator.  It also will not resolve the family dynamic issues we tend to find when we look further into the lives of truants.  KKIS leverages the expertise and support of various agencies in the community who are instrumental in providing support and follow-up for targeted students.  KKIS has also engaged local attorneys in the provision of pro bono services as a means of providing fair representation for the child as required under the law.  This aspect of KKIS has strengthened the program by helping students understand their rights and the workings of the legal system.  More importantly, members of the legal community including the judges have become important role models and, in some cases, mentors for youths involved in the program.  This, combined with enforcement and accountability, has made KKIS a uniquely innovative and powerful program for combating school truancy and keeping schools safer.</p>\n\n<p>For additional information <strong>contact: Patty Wallace, Associate Court Executive Office at (559) 457-2010</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"mediation\"></a><h2>Mediation Pilot Program Study</h2>\n\nIn the fall of 1999, Fresno Superior Court applied for a grant offered by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) to test mediation.  Four courts were chosen from around the State to participate.  Two of the courts were to study the impact of mediation on cases that volunteered for the program and two were to study cases that were ordered to mediate.  Fresno Superior Court was one of the courts chosen to develop and implement a Pilot Program for Mandatory Mediation.  \n\n<p>To begin the Pilot Program the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Department recruited and trained approximately forty local attorneys, retired judges and non-attorney professional mediators.  Eventually, this roster of mediators grew to include nearly one hundred individuals. Each of these mediators agreed to accept the court's fee and payment in full for the first four hours of mediation. In the spring of 2000 the Court began to select cases and ordered them to participate in mediation. After each mediation, everyone involved; the attorneys, the parties, and the mediators were required to complete a questionnaire which address four areas of concern; the outcome of the mediation, the time and cost of the mediation, and their satisfaction with the process and the Court.</p>\n\n<p>For the next three years mediations took place and data was gathered. The data was sent to the AOC on cases mediated statewide.  This data was compared to data collected on cases not mediated. As a result of the mediations more than 500 hundred cases were settled prior to trial in Fresno alone. Further, the mediators gained valuable experience from the increased caseload and local disputants became increasingly knowledgeable about mediation.  The ADR culture, which had been virtually non-existent, began to flourish as more and more attorneys and clients participated in the Pilot Program.  These mediations, in conjunction with the restructuring of the Civil Department and implementation of a new case management system, directly contributed to the complete elimination of the backlog of Civil cases in Fresno Superior Court.</p>\n\n<p>At the conclusion of the Pilot Program in 2003, the AOC completed their analysis of all the data and published a final report that may be found at www.courts.ca.gov/reference.  The findings were highly favorable in every category and the rate at which cases settled prior to the trial did increase. Cases settled in less time and with fewer Court appearances, and at a significantly reduced cost. And most importantly, the satisfaction level of both attorneys and disputants with the Court and the process was tremendously favorable. The data showed overwhelmingly that the participants would opt for mediation in the future, regardless of whether settlement was reached in their first case.</p>\n\n<p>Fresno County Superior Court has benefited in many ways from being a part of the Pilot Program for Mandatory Mediation.  Most importantly, our participation in the study helped create a culture shift in our legal community and the court systems.  Prior to the Pilot Program there were very few alternatives available through the court for parties to seek resolution of their case aside from the regular legal remedies.  Now parties and attorneys are aware of alternative options available through the court to help resolve disputes, decrease costs, and have a greater outcome satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>For additional information, please <strong>contact Mari Henson, ADR Administrator at (559) 497-4194.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\t\t\t<!-- END BODY -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr></table>", "parent": "http://www.fresno.courts.ca.gov/general_info/"},

When the area was later devastated by a flood,  the seat of county government was moved to its present location in 1874. The  second Fresno County courthouse was completed in August 1875 at a cost of  $56,000 and was three stories tall. The building's two courtrooms were located  on the second floor with ceilings that reached 22 feet. Samuel Ash Holmes was  then appointed the first Fresno Superior Court judge in 1879.</p>\n<p>In 1893, a new copper dome was erected on the courthouse and two wings were  added. On the evening of July 29, 1895, streams of molten copper flowed from  the huge dome as a fire gutted the central portion of the building. Within the  year, the damages were repaired and a more modest dome replaced the copper one destroyed by the fire. The second courthouse was eventually torn down and the  present day courthouse completed in 1966.</p>\n<p>In June 1998, the California electorate approved constitutional amendments  permitting superior and municipal courts to fully unify. The judges in Fresno  County agreed to unify all courts into the Superior Court of Fresno County  effective July 1, 1998, abolishing the municipal courts.</p>\n<h3>The Court Today</h3>\n<p>The Fresno Superior Court currently has 43 judges, six commissioners, and  approximately 430 employees. In addition to the main courthouse that houses the  criminal and juvenile dependency courts, other facilities include the B.F.

The bailiff will remove individuals who are not quiet while court is in session. No laughing, whispering, giggling, talking or applauding, nor gum chewing, eating or drinking is allowed in the courtroom. All electronic devices, such as cellular phones and pagers, must be in silent mode or turned off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Arranging Your Visit to the Courthouse</h3>\n\n<strong>Scheduling</strong><br>\nSelf-guided tours and courtroom observation may be arranged by contacting the Juror &amp; Public Services Manager at (559) 457-1605. Visits may be scheduled for Monday through Friday during court hours, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m..\n\n<p><strong>Agenda</strong><br>Visits should be scheduled with the Juror &amp; Public Services Manager at least 2 weeks prior to the date you would like to visit. Discuss your group's interests with the Juror &amp; Public Services Manager, including any request for informational presentations by a judge, commissioner, or deputy sheriff. You must call the Juror &amp; Public Services Manager the day before your visit for confirmation and your agenda.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Group Size</strong><br>The court will attempt to accommodate any sized group. It may be necessary, however, to limit the number of individuals entering a courtroom during ongoing proceedings. Generally, trial courtrooms can accommodate larger groups. Large groups may want to split into smaller groups to enable observation of courtrooms with limited space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Visiting the Courthouse</h3>\n\n<strong>Entering the Courthouse</strong><br>\n\nThe lobby has a metal detector and an airport type x-ray machine for screening purposes. All weapons, including pocketknives of all sizes, tear gas, stun guns, scissors, knitting needles, etc., cannot be brought into the courthouse. Even the smallest of these objects will not be allowed.

The most common is dissolution of marriage (often referred to as divorce). There are only two grounds used for obtaining dissolution, either \"irreconcilable differences\" or \"incurable insanity.\" Most dissolution cases request an end to the marriage based on irreconcilable differences. California court is a \"no-fault\" state, which means the court does not need to find that one spouse is at fault for the breakdown of the marriage. The existence of irreconcilable differences provides the court with the grounds to make a divorce or separation Judgment.\n<p>A marriage may be dissolved on the grounds of incurable insanity \" . . . only upon proof, including competent medical or psychiatric testimony, that the insane person was insane at the time the petition was filed, and remains incurably insane\" (Family Code Section 2312).</p>\n<p>To file for dissolution, either you or your spouse must meet California's residency requirements. Either you or your spouse must have lived in California for at least six (6) months prior to filing your case AND either you or your spouse must have lived in the county where you will be filing the dissolution case for at least three (3) months prior to filing your case. There can be situations where both parties reside in California for at least six (6) months but they lived in different counties for the last three (3) months. In this situation, a party can elect to file in either county. The court you file in is the court that handles your dissolution case unless both parties have moved from the county and have formally obtained a change in venue.</p>\n\n<h3>Legal Separation</h3>\nYou do not have to meet any of the above residency requirements to request either a legal separation or a nullity of marriage. Most parties choose dissolution rather than a legal separation. Dissolution divides property and debts, makes orders regarding child custody, child support and spousal support, and terminates the marriage (restoring the parties to the status of unmarried persons).\n<p>Parties may choose to formally separate their lives but remain married for religious or other personal reasons (i.e., maintain medical insurance, qualify for derivative social security benefits). Both parties must agree to a request for legal separation. If one party files documentation requesting a legal separation and the other party file documentation requesting dissolution, the judge will grant the dissolution. If the marriage ends with the judge granting a Judgment for Legal Separation, either party may file a separate dissolution case to terminate the marital status to return both parties to the status of unmarried persons.</p>\n<p>If you desire dissolution but neither you nor your spouse meets California's residency requirements, you may initiate a case requesting a legal separation. Once either party meets the residency requirements, you can amend the Petition form to request dissolution.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Nullity</h3>\nA nullity of marriage (sometimes referred to as an annulment) is rarely used. If the judge grants a nullity of marriage, it is as if the marriage never legally existed and restores the parties to the status of unmarried persons. Certain conditions must be met before the Court will find the marriage void (Family Code Sections 2200-2201) or voidable (Family Code Sections 2210) and grant a nullity of marriage.\n<p>Further, the conditions for nullity of marriage must have existed at the time of the marriage. There are time limits, which will prevent you from raising the issue of a voidable marriage. Time limits vary but are generally four years after the date of the marriage. Once these time limits have passed, you will need to end the marriage and resolve issues by requesting either a dissolution or legal separation. Even though the marriage is considered invalid, depending on the facts of the case, you may still be treated like a spouse for the purposes of property and debt division, custody and support as if the marriage had been valid.</p>\n\n<h3>The Process of Terminating a Marriage</h3>\nThe process of divorce begins when you file your initial papers.  Before your dissolution is complete, all the issues must be resolved, either by default, agreement or through contested court proceedings.  Each case is different.  The process may take several months if the case is uncontested, or it could take years if there are a lot of disputes or complex issues.\n\n<h3>Do not assume that you are divorced until there is a judgment filed and entered by the court</h3>\nA person is able to remarry only after the Judgment has been entered terminating marital status. The earliest possible date upon which marital status can be terminated is 6 months and 1 day after the Respondent was served with the Petition and Summons for dissolution.  However, in many cases, it takes much longer than this to bring the case to final Judgment.\n<p>It is important to know that you will not receive a Judgment of divorce automatically. You will not receive a divorce Judgment just by filing and serving a Summons and Petition, or just by filing and serving a Response. Even if the no response is filed your divorce is not final.  You must take additional steps.  In most cases, you and your spouse will either need to negotiate, prepare and file with the court a MARITAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT and some related forms, or if you cannot agree, set the case for trial, present your evidence, receive orders and then prepare and file the Judgment according to the court's orders. In some cases known as \"true default cases\", where Respondent never files a Response and the spouses do not have a Marital Settlement Agreement, it is possible for Petitioner to get a final Judgment of divorce without Respondent needing to be involved.</p>\n<p>Do not assume that you are divorced until you have seen a file-stamped Judgment from the court that says you are divorced. Remember that this will not happen automatically - you and/or your spouse must continually work the case through to the Judgment stage. You are not free to remarry until you are divorced.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Common Questions</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>May I serve papers in my own case?</strong><br>\nNo, you cannot serve papers in your own case.  Anyone over the age of eighteen (18) who is not a party to the action can serve papers on the other side.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When is my divorce final?</strong><br>\nThe earliest date your marital status can terminate is six months and 1 day from the day your spouse is served with papers or files a response, whichever is earlier.  Please note that after initial paperwork is filed you need to file various other papers with the court in order for marriage status to terminate.  Termination of marriage does not happen automatically once initial paperwork is filed and six months from service/first appearance has passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How are property issues resolved in a divorce or separation case?</strong><br>\nProperty issues and division of community assets and debts are ordinarily resolved by a signed marital settlement agreement or by an agreement placed on the record (and later formalized in writing) at a mandatory settlement conference.  If settlement is not reached, contested issues are set for trial for court determination.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do I schedule trial dates and/or a settlement conference for my divorce or separation case?</strong><br>\nOnce a petition and response is on file, trial dates and settlement conferences can be obtained by filing an At Issue Memorandum.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<a name=\"2\"></a><h2>Establishing Parentage (Paternity)</h2>\nAn unmarried mother files this action or by an unmarried father who have minor children together. Through this action, the Court will determine paternity (or non-paternity if the father is found not to be the biological father of the minor children), and make custody and visitation as well as child support orders.\n<p>Once an action is filed by a Petitioner, the other party, Respondent, must be personally served with specific paperwork. If the Respondent fails to file the necessary responding paperwork within thirty (30) days of service, the Petitioner may request the entry of default. Once the default is entered, the Petitioner can complete the paternity proceeding without the participation of the Respondent.</p>\n<p>If the Respondent files the necessary responding paperwork, the case will then proceed as either a contested matter or an uncontested matter. The action is considered contested if the parties are unable to agree on some or all issues and the Court must resolve the unresolved issues. The action is considered uncontested if the parties are able to cooperate and agree on all issues outside of Court and the matter can proceed to its conclusion by submitting the necessary signed paperwork for the Court's signature.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"3\"></a><h2>Child Custody and Visitation</h2>\n<h3>Petition for Custody and Visitation</h3>\nThis action may be filed by married or unmarried parents to obtain custody and support orders without filing a dissolution of marriage/legal separation or nullity action, if the parents of the minor children are married, or without filing an action to establish a parental relationship, if the parents of the minor children are unmarried. This action is limited and can only be used in certain situations by a married or unmarried parent. This action does not deal with property or marital status, if the parents are married, or establish a parental relationship, if the parents are unmarried. To address these other issues, the married parents would need to file an action requesting dissolution of marriage/legal separation or nullity action. Unmarried parents need to file an action to establish the parental relationship.\n<p>Before parents can address the issues of custody and visitation of their minor children, there must be an underlying action. If the parents are married, either the mother or the father must first file an action requesting dissolution of marriage, legal separation, nullity or file the petition for custody and support of minor children's action. If the parents are unmarried, either the mother or the father must file an action to establish the parental relationship or file the petition for custody and support of minor children. Once an underlying action has been filed, the Court can address the issues of custody and visitation.</p>\n<p>There are two types of custody, and the court needs to make orders concerning each type.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Legal custody</strong> means, which parent, will have decision-making power over the child's health, education and welfare issues. The court can order that the parents have joint legal custody (meaning they have equal decision-making power), or the court can order that one parent have sole legal custody (the only right to make decisions about the child).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical custody</strong> means where (with which parent) the child will primarily reside. A court can order that both parents have significant time with the child. This can be called \"joint custody\". The court could instead order that one parent will have physical custody, and the other parent will have visitation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The legal standard that the court uses to determine what type of custody orders to make in your case is the best interests of the child. This is a flexible standard that allows each family's and each child's needs to be considered. In determining what is in the best interests of the child, the court may consider the health, safety and welfare of the child, the nature and amount of the child's contact with both parents, the habitual or continual illegal use of controlled substances or alcohol by either parent, and/or any history of abuse by one parent against any related child, against the other parent and/or against any person with which the parent has been romantically involved. It is the public policy of the state of California that a child will have frequent and continuing contact with each parent, unless such contact is deemed not be in the child's best interests.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"4\"></a><h2>Child Support</h2>\n<h3>The child support guideline</h3>\nChild support in California is based on a mandatory uniform guideline, which uses an algebraic formula to determine the amount of child support. It is primarily based on each parent's tax filing status (single, married or head of household) and average monthly income. Allowances are made for mandatory deductions such as federal and state taxes, and health insurance premiums and union dues paid. A deduction is also given for any child and/or spousal support that a parent pays for a child and/or spouse from another relationship.\n<p>There is no deduction given for either parent's specific living expenses (such as rent, car payment, credit card bills, etc.) Depending on the number of children and the amount of income the paying parent has, the percentage of take-home pay which goes for child support can range from approximately forty to fifty percent or more of that parent's after-tax income (net income).  The other important factor that influences the amount of support that will be ordered is the amount of time each parent has physical responsibility for the child.</p>\n<p>The child support guideline has been in effect since 1992, and is applied by all courts in the 58 counties of California. Judicial officers must order the guideline child support amount, even if the amount of support seems high, unless there are very special circumstances that allow the court to decrease or increase the guideline amount. By contrast, parents can agree to a child support figure that is below or above guideline (note: parents are not able to make their own agreement regarding child support if either parent receives welfare).</p>\n\n<h3>Tax aspects of child support</h3>\nChild support is not tax deductible to the parent paying it, and it is not taxable income to the parent receiving it. Spousal support has a different tax treatment (see below). However, in a divorce or separation case, sometimes a court orders, or the parents agree to, a \"family support\" order. This means that the child and spousal support order is combined and characterized as a family support order. The amount of the order is increased, and the entire amount is made tax deductible to the spouse paying it, and must be claimed as taxable income by the spouse receiving it. Family support is usually only ordered or agreed to in cases where at least one parent has an extraordinarily high income.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Allocation of dependency exemptions for minor children</h3>\nUnder state and federal tax law, a parent is entitled to claim a child as a tax dependent if that child has been in the parent's home more than half of that tax year. In a child support context, this usually means that the parent who is the \"custodial parent\", or who has the child more than 50% of the time, has the right to claim the child as a tax dependent.\n<p>One of the factors in determining guideline child support is a parent's tax filing status, which includes the number of dependency exemptions that a parent is entitled to claim under state and federal tax law. The judicial officer's child support calculation will include an allocation of the dependency exemption(s) for the child(ren) involved in your case. This means the child support calculation and order made thereon is based, in part, on assigning one of the parents the applicable dependency exemption(s).</p>\n<p>If a parent is entitled to claim a dependency exemption, that parent will also be eligible for the child tax credit and the earned income credit (as applicable, and if available at that parent's income level).</p>\n<p>If you have a child support order, look at the calculation upon which it is based to see how the court allocated the dependency exemption(s). Usually, the dependency exemption(s) is allocated to the custodial parent. Sometimes, a support calculation will release the dependency exemption(s) to the noncustodial but higher net income parent because that has a better tax effect for both parents.</p>\n\n<h3>Child support orders based on earning capacity</h3>\nA court usually bases a child support order on each parent's actual income. Income from all sources (including overtime, bonuses, rental income, investment income, etc.) is considered. If a parent is unemployed or under-employed (below 40 hours per week), a court can base a child support order on a parent's earning capacity. The court then considers what a parent is capable of earning. The court must find that a parent has an opportunity and ability to work before it can \"impute\" an earning capacity to a parent and base a child support order on a parent's earning capacity. Either a custodial parent or a non-custodial parent can be imputed an earning capacity in calculating guideline child support.\n\n<h3>Childcare expenses</h3>\nSeparate and apart from the guideline child support ordered, the court must order the parents to share equally any work-related child care expenses (day care, baby sitters) that either or both parents incur. Sometimes the cost of childcare, even when it is equally split with the other parent by court order, can be more than a guideline child support order.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Additional factors influencing child support</h3>\nA court may adjust the amount of guideline child support that would otherwise be ordered to take into account a child's educational or other special needs, or travel expenses that one parent incurs for visitation (for example, the non-custodial parent pays for the child to travel to and from another state for court-ordered visitation with the non-custodial parent).\n<p>A court may also adjust the amount of guideline child support that would otherwise be ordered if it finds circumstances evidencing hardship to a parent. Such circumstances are defined as extraordinary health expenses for which the parent is financially responsible, uninsured \"catastrophic losses\" and the minimum basic living expenses of a parent's natural or adopted child(ren) from other relationships for whom the parent has the obligation to support and who reside with the parent.</p>\n\n<h3>Wage and Earnings Assignment Orders</h3>\nA court must issue a Wage and Earnings Assignment Order each time that a court makes a support order. One of the parents must prepare and file with the court clerk the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order - the Judge does not prepare it for you. If DCSS is involved in your case, that office will prepare and file the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order.\n<p>One of the parents can then provide a filed copy of the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order to the paying parent's employer. The Order instructs the employer to withhold the amount of support ordered from the employer's wages, and forward the support payment to the custodial parent (or DCSS, as applicable).</p>\n<p>The Family Law Facilitator's Office can help you obtain a Wage and Earnings Assignment Order if you do not have one yet.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"5\"></a><h2>Department of Child Support Services (DCSS)</h2>\nTo visit their website, <a href=\"http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/Departments.aspx?id=124\">click here</a>.\n<p>DCSS operates in each County in California to establish, modify and enforce (collect) child support orders. DCSS will also establish a paternity (parentage) order and health insurance order when applicable. DCSS will become automatically involved in a child support case when a child receives welfare. In non-welfare cases, a custodial parent can request that DCSS open up a case to establish, modify and/or enforce (collect) a child support order. DCSS services are provided free of charge.</p>\n<p>If you are served with a Summons and Complaint packet by DCSS, you have 30 days to file an Answer with the court clerk. If you don't, the court will make orders against you by default, including paternity, child support, child support arrears (if applicable) and health insurance. Filing an Answer to the lawsuit with the court clerk will mean that DCSS cannot get any orders against you by default, or without your having an opportunity to present your case to a judicial officer, including requesting a genetic test if you are not sure you are the parent of the child(ren).</p>\n<p>DCSS in Fresno County is located at 2220 Tulare Street, Suite 310P, Fresno, CA 93721. Their mailing address is P.O. Box 12946 (93779-2946), Fresno, CA 93721. Their telephone number is (559)494-1090 or (559)494-1000.</p>\n<p>In cases where a child has received or is receiving welfare, federal law allows the DCSS to obtain a court order for child support back to the date the child first started receiving welfare, subject to a three year retroactive limit before the date DCSS filed the Complaint (lawsuit) with the court. Effective 1/1/2000, new California law allows DCSS to go back only one year prior to filing the Complaint for a welfare reimbursement (child support) order.</p>\n<p>Many parents incorrectly believe they are being sued by DCSS to pay back the amount of the welfare the other parent and/or the child received. This is wrong. The law requires that the court make an order for the amount of guideline child support that the \"absent parent\" (or non-custodial parent) should have been paying during the time that the child received welfare and the non-custodial parent was not living with (and contributing to the support of) the child. A child's receipt of welfare will trigger a child support lawsuit brought by DCSS against the non-custodial parent.</p>\n<p>DCSS has special enforcement (collection) powers to collect child support. If any arrears (back support) are owed, DCSS can suspend a non-paying parent's drivers', professional or recreational license and/or suspend a passport. DCSS can intercept (take) a non-paying parent's state and federal tax refunds.</p>\n\n<h3>Sometimes each parent is asked to pay child support</h3>\nIf a child is not in the custody of either parent and the child receives welfare, DCSS will sue each parent in order to obtain a child support order. This happens when a child is in a group home, foster care, or living with a relative or other caretaker and receiving welfare. If the parents do not live together, they will be sued separately by DCSS and their child support obligation will be determined independent of the other parent's ability to pay child support as calculated under the guideline.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"6\"></a><h2>Child Support Modifications</h2>\nChild support cannot be modified (changed) for periods of time in the past (after an order has been made but before a \"paying\" or non-custodial parent makes a court request to reduce the amount of support, or before the \"receiving\" or custodial parent makes a court request to increase the amount of support). In other words, the court-ordered child support figure continues in effect until the court later modifies it and makes a new order. Usually, the earliest effective date for a modification is the date a parent files or serves a motion (a request for a court order) requesting a modification.\n<p>A parent who feels the need to have the child support order modified because of a change in circumstances since the last order was made needs to file a modification request in a timely manner. Under California law, child support is modifiable any time a parent can show the court that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the last order was made. If a parent believes there is such a change in circumstances, that parent needs to bring the new information to the court's attention right away (by filing a motion for modification) in order to obtain a new order that takes effect right away.</p>\n\n<a name=\"7\"></a><h2>Interest on Child Support</h2>\nInterest at the legal rate (currently 10 per cent per year) is owed on all unpaid child support (called back support, or \"arrears\"). The interest does not compound, meaning interest does not build up on the interest, but it accrues on the principal amount owed only (the child support amount ordered). Left unpaid, the amount of support arrears owed over time grows to sometimes astronomical numbers once the interest is added on. California law gives judicial officers no power to waive or adjust arrears that have accrued, or the interest that has accrued on those arrears.\n\n<a name=\"8\"></a><h2>Duration of a Child Support Order</h2>\nA California support obligation ends, normally, when the child turns 18. If the child is 18 but still residing at home, still attending high school full-time and still not self-supporting, then the child support obligation ends when the child graduates high school or turns 19, whichever comes first. The court may extend the duration of child support if an adult child is disabled. Parents can agree on their own to extend the duration of a child support order.\n<p>Any arrears continue to be owed until paid in full, regardless of the child's age. Arrears mean that there was a valid court order that support be paid, but the parent ordered to pay support did not pay some or all of the support while the obligation continued.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"9\"></a><h2>Health Insurance</h2>\nCalifornia law requires both parents to provide health insurance coverage for their child if such coverage is available at no cost or at reasonable cost. What is a \"reasonable\" cost is different from case to case.\n<p>Parents who do not have health insurance coverage for their child should look into the state program called HEALTHY FAMILIES. For more information and/or for an application, you can contact 1-800-880-5305 Monday through Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM.</p>\n<p>Both parents are also required to share a child's uninsured health care expenses (out-of-pocket or unreimbursed expenses such as co-payments) equally if an order is in place that requires parents to share such expenses. This means that if a child has orthodontia (braces) and the uninsured cost will be $1000.00, each parent will be required to pay $500.00 as long as there is an order in place that requires the parents to share such an uninsured expense. Make sure you request this order from the court so it applies in your case.</p>\n\n<a name=\"10\"></a><h2>Spousal Support</h2>\nSpouses can request that the court make a spousal support order as part of a divorce or separation case. Spousal support is a discretionary order, meaning the court has great freedom in determining what amount of support, if any, should be paid in a particular case, and for how long spousal support should be paid.\n<p>At the \"temporary\" stage of a case, meaning from the time the divorce or separation case is filed up until the time a final Judgment is entered, the court often uses the support guideline (see above discussion on child support for guideline factors) to determine what amount of spousal support should be paid. The court is not required to order the guideline amount. The guideline amount is based on each spouse's income, tax filing status, and certain allowed deductions such as health insurance and union dues.</p>\n<p>At the \"permanent\" stage of a case, meaning after a final Judgment of separation or divorce has been entered, the court must consider certain statutory factors in deciding (1) what amount of spousal support to order, if any; and (2) the duration (how many months or years) of the order. The court considers factors such as the age and health of the spouses, the length of the marriage, and each spouse's job skills. See Family Code section 4320 for more information. Unless a court has reason not to do so, \"permanent\" spousal support will usually have duration of half the length of the marriage, measured from date of marriage through date of separation.</p>\n<p>Unlike child support, spousal support is tax deductible to the spouse paying it (only those payments made after a court order is in place are tax deductible), and the spouse collecting it must claim the amount received in any given tax year as taxable income.</p>\n<p>Spousal support terminates per court order, or naturally by the death of either spouse or the remarriage of the supported spouse. If you want the court to modify or terminate a court order for spousal support, you will need to file and serve a motion to request a modification or termination unless the order itself has a built-in modification amount and/ or termination date.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"11\"></a><h2>Community Property and Separate Property Defined</h2>\nTo be able to characterize your assets or debts as community or separate, it helps to know what your \"date of separation\" is. The date of separation is generally defined as that date you knew the marriage was irremediably broken. This means the date at which at least one spouse knew there was no hope for saving the marriage. For some people, this may be the date you moved out, or the date you filed for divorce.\n<p>Community property is generally defined as assets acquired through a spouse's time, labor and skills, from date of marriage through and including date of separation. Community property is usually everything that a married couple own together (title to certain assets does not have to be in both spouses' names in order to be considered community property), such as money that you now have which either spouse earned during the time they were living together as husband and wife, or anything either spouse bought with money earned during that time period. Community property can be things like a car, a house, a security deposit on an apartment, a 401(k) account, a pension, a bank account, home furnishings, etc.</p>\n<p>Community debts are generally defined as the debts that a husband and wife owe together. In most cases, that includes anything you still owe on any debts either of you took on during the time you were living together as husband and wife.</p>\n<p>California law requires that the spouses divide community property and debts equally. To equalize the division of assets and debts, one spouse may get more assets because they also got more debts. Spouses can agree to divide assets and debts unequally if they would like.</p>\n<p>Separate property is generally defined as everything that a husband and wife own or owe (if it is a debt) separately. It includes assets acquired, or debts incurred, before date of marriage or after date of separation. It also includes any assets acquired by the spouse during the marriage by gift (to that spouse alone) or inheritance. California law requires that separate property assets or debts be confirmed to the spouse who acquired or incurred them. Family law attorneys can be extremely helpful with property and debt issues.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"12\"></a><h2>Mandatory Disclosure</h2>\nCalifornia law requires spouses in a divorce or separation case to provide each other with forms to disclose assets and debts, and income and expenses. This is to help each spouse develop information about the \"marital estate\" - what property and debt issues there are. This in turn helps prepare the case for final Judgment.\n\n<a name=\"13\"></a><h2>Domestic Violence Restraining Orders</h2>\nDomestic violence temporary restraining order forms, information sheets and fee waiver packets are available at the Family Law Clerk's Office, Family Law Facilitator's Office or at Centro De Recursos Legales.  There is no charge for these forms and there is no filing fee.\n\n<p>A restraining order is a Court order issued to prevent the recurrence of acts of abuse by a batterer. Under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, abuse is defined as any of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury.</li>\n\t<li>Sexual assault.</li>\n\t<li>Placing a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.</li>\n\t<li>Engaging in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined such as molesting, attacking, striking, stalking, threatening, battering, harassing, telephoning, destroying personal property, contacting the other by mail or otherwise, disturbing the peace of the other party.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The act(s) of abuse/violence must be recent, within thirty days, and the batterer must be a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, ex-boyfriend/ex-girlfriend, someone with whom the victim has or has had a dating relationship, an immediate family member (mother, father, in-laws, siblings, adult children), or a person with whom a party has a child/ren together. A victim that is a target of abuse but does not have the necessary relationship to the batterer may file a civil harassment restraining order, discussed below.</p>\n<p>The restraining order can include the following: restraints on personal conduct by the batterer; orders for the batterer to stay-away from the victim's home/work and/or children's school; orders for the batterer to be removed from the residence; child custody and visitation and support orders and other miscellaneous orders.</p>\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<a name=\"14\"></a><h2>Family Law Limted Scope Representation</h2>\n\n<h3>Unbundling of Legal Services: A New Approach to Representation</h3>\n<p>The traditional approach to legal services is that a client hires an attorney to represent them on their case.  This means that the attorney represents the client on all aspects of their case from start to finish.  The representation does not end unless there is a substitution of attorney.  Limited Scope Representation, often referred to as Unbundling, is a modification of the traditional approach.  Unbundling allows an attorney to represent a client on limited, precise issues of their case or to perform specific tasks for the client.   The attorney and the client consult and determine the specific areas of the case that the attorney will handle and which tasks the attorney will perform.  The client is then responsible for the other aspects of the case and may perform the additional tasks not performed by the attorney.\n\n</p><h3>How Unbundling Works</h3>\nA typical family law case could involve tasks such as information gathering, drafting of documents, legal research, negotiations, court appearances and conducting discovery.  The case could involve a number of issues including child and spousal support, division of real property, pension plans and retirement and child custody and visitation. Unbundling provides a way that an attorney can help you with a part of your case.  The rest of the case is your responsibility.   \n<p>For example, you may gather all the necessary information and then have an attorney prepare your court documents.  Or you may prepare your own documents and then have an attorney review your documents before filing.  You may consult an attorney who may coach you on how to appear in court by yourself.  Or you may do all the pre-court work yourself and then have an attorney make the court appearances. You may choose to have an attorney handle the more complicated aspects of your case and give you advice on how to handle the simpler issues yourself.  In all these situations the attorney only bills you and you only pay for the parts of the case the attorney handles.  \n\n</p><h3>Important Issues that Must be Decided</h3>\nYou and your attorney must thoroughly discuss all the aspects of your case.  This is the only way to be sure that each of you understands his or her responsibilities regarding the case.  Things that must be discussed include: who makes strategy decisions?  Who will gather the necessary information? Who will prepare the court documents? Who will appear in court? Who will negotiate with the other party and/or attorney?\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Benefits of Unbundling</h3>\nBy assisting in your own representation and performing some tasks yourself; you can make the most efficient use of the attorney's time and your own litigation budget.   The attorney will be able to focus on the more difficult aspects of the case and you will retain greater control of your case.\n\n\n<h3>Trade-Offs of Unbundling</h3>\nYour attorney has much more experience than you do.  You must be aware that you are fully responsible for the outcome of the parts of the case you handle yourself, even if your attorney is coaching you.  You must take the time to fully discuss your case with your attorney to ensure that you are comfortable in handling portions of the case.\n\n<h3>Will Unbundling Work for Every Case</h3>\nThere are times when Unbundling is not the best option.  In some cases where issues are so complicated and intertwined, it is best to have an attorney handle all aspects of the case.  The only way to know if Unbundling is the best choice for you is to thoroughly discuss your case with your attorney so that any hidden complications can be identified.\n\n<h3>How Does the Court Feel About Unbundling</h3>\nFresno Superior Court is in favor of Unbundling.  Unbundling provides a method for litigants to get as much legal assistance as needed.  This in turn helps you do a better job of presenting your case to the court.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>What if Further Assistance is Needed</h3>\nNew issues may arise during the course of your case.  If you feel that you need further assistance you may go back to the attorney that is providing the limited scope representation and arrange for further assistance.  The benefit of going back to the same attorney is that that attorney is already familiar with your case.  This will cut down on time and expense of getting a new attorney up to speed with your case.   During the course of your lawsuit you may also decide that you no longer want to handle parts of the case yourself.  In this situation you may wish to hire the attorney who is providing limited scope representation to handle your entire case.\n\n<h3>What if You and Your Attorney Disagree</h3>\nRemember that you and your attorney are working as a team.  However, it is your case and you must make the ultimate decision and take responsibility.  You should carefully consider your attorney's recommendations.  If you choose to disregard your attorney's advice you must be willing to accept responsibility for your decision.\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\t\t\t<!-- END BODY -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</td></tr></table>", "parent": "http://www.fresno.courts.ca.gov/family/"},

It is primarily based on each parent's tax filing status (single, married or head of household) and average monthly income. Allowances are made for mandatory deductions such as federal and state taxes, and health insurance premiums and union dues paid. A deduction is also given for any child and/or spousal support that a parent pays for a child and/or spouse from another relationship.\n\n<p>There is no deduction given for either parent's specific living expenses (such as rent, car payment, credit card bills, etc.) Depending on the number of children and the amount of income the paying parent has, the percentage of take-home pay which goes for child support can range from approximately forty to fifty percent or more of that parent's after-tax income (net income).  The other important factor that influences the amount of support that will be ordered is the amount of time each parent has physical responsibility for the child.</p>\n\n<p>The child support guideline has been in effect since 1992 , and is applied by all courts in the 58 counties of California. Judicial officers must order the guideline child support amount, even if the amount of support seems high, unless there are very special circumstances that allow the court to decrease or increase the guideline amount. By contrast, parents can agree to a child support figure that is below or above guideline (note: parents are not able to make their own agreement regarding child support if either parent receives welfare).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tax aspects of child support</h3>\n\nChild support is not tax deductible to the parent paying it, and it is not taxable income to the parent receiving it. Spousal support has a different tax treatment (see below). However, in a divorce or separation case, sometimes a court orders, or the parents agree to, a \"family support\" order. This means that the child and spousal support order is combined and characterized as a family support order. The amount of the order is increased, and the entire amount is made tax deductible to the spouse paying it, and must be claimed as taxable income by the spouse receiving it. Family support is usually only ordered or agreed to in cases where at least one parent has an extraordinarily high income.\n\n\n\n<h3>Allocation of dependency exemptions for minor children</h3>\n\nUnder state and federal tax law, a parent is entitled to claim a child as a tax dependent if that child has been in the parent's home more than half of that tax year. In a child support context, this usually means that the parent who is the \"custodial parent\", or who has the child more than 50% of the time, has the right to claim the child as a tax dependent.\n\n<p>One of the factors in determining guideline child support is a parent's tax filing status, which includes the number of dependency exemptions that a parent is entitled to claim under state and federal tax law. The judicial officer's child support calculation will include an allocation of the dependency exemption(s) for the child(ren) involved in your case. This means the child support calculation and order made thereon is based, in part, on assigning one of the parents the applicable dependency exemption(s).</p>\n\n<p>If a parent is entitled to claim a dependency exemption, that parent will also be eligible for the child tax credit and the earned income credit (as applicable, and if available at that parent's income level).</p>\n\n<p>If you have a child support order, look at the calculation upon which it is based to see how the court allocated the dependency exemption(s). Usually, the dependency exemption(s) is allocated to the custodial parent. Sometimes, a support calculation will release the dependency exemption(s) to the noncustodial but higher net income parent because that has a better tax effect for both parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Child support orders based on earning capacity</h3>\n\nA court usually bases a child support order on each parent's actual income. Income from all sources (including overtime, bonuses, rental income, investment income, etc.) is considered. If a parent is unemployed or under-employed (below 40 hours per week), a court can base a child support order on a parent's earning capacity. The court then considers what a parent is capable of earning. The court must find that a parent has an opportunity and ability to work before it can \"impute\" an earning capacity to a parent and base a child support order on a parent's earning capacity. Either a custodial parent or a non-custodial parent can be imputed an earning capacity in calculating guideline child support.\n\n\n\n<h3>Childcare expenses</h3>\n\nSeparate and apart from the guideline child support ordered, the court must order the parents to share equally any work-related child care expenses (day care, baby sitters) that either or both parents incur. Sometimes the cost of childcare, even when it is equally split with the other parent by court order, can be more than a guideline child support order.\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h3>Additional factors influencing child support</h3>\n\nA court may adjust the amount of guideline child support that would otherwise be ordered to take into account a child's educational or other special needs, or travel expenses that one parent incurs for visitation (for example, the non-custodial parent pays for the child to travel to and from another state for court-ordered visitation with the non-custodial parent).\n\n<p>A court may also adjust the amount of guideline child support that would otherwise be ordered if it finds circumstances evidencing hardship to a parent. Such circumstances are defined as extraordinary health expenses for which the parent is financially responsible, uninsured \"catastrophic losses\" and the minimum basic living expenses of a parent's natural or adopted child(ren) from other relationships for whom the parent has the obligation to support and who reside with the parent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wage and Earnings Assignment Orders</h3>\n\nA court must issue a Wage and Earnings Assignment Order each time a court makes a support order. One of the parents must prepare and file with the court clerk the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order - the Judge does not prepare it for you. If DCSS is involved in your case, that office will prepare and file the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order.\n\n<p>One of the parents can then provide a filed copy of the Wage and Earnings Assignment Order to the paying parent's employer. The Order instructs the employer to withhold the amount of support ordered from the employer's wages, and forward the support payment to the custodial parent (or DCSS, as applicable).</p>\n\n<p>The Family Law Facilitator's Office can help you obtain a Wage and Earnings Assignment Order if you do not have one yet.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"5\"></a><h2>Department of Child Support Services (DCSS)</h2>\n\nDCSS operates in each County in California to establish, modify and enforce (collect) child support orders. DCSS will also establish a paternity (parentage) order and health insurance order when applicable. DCSS will become automatically involved in a child support case when a child receives welfare. In non-welfare cases, a custodial parent can request that DCSS open up a case to establish, modify and/or enforce (collect) a child support order. DCSS services are provided free of charge.\n\n<p>If you are served with a Summons and Complaint packet by DCSS, you have 30 days to file an Answer with the court clerk. If you don't, the court will make orders against you by default, including paternity, child support, child support arrears (if applicable) and health insurance. Filing an Answer to the lawsuit with the court clerk will mean that DCSS cannot get any orders against you by default, or without your having an opportunity to present your case to a judicial officer, including requesting a genetic test if you are not sure you are the parent of the child(ren).</p>\n\n<p>DCSS in Fresno County is located at 2220 Tulare Street, Suite 310P, Fresno, CA 93721. Their mailing address is P.O. Box 12946 (93779-2946), Fresno, CA 93721. Their telephone number is (559)494-1090 or (559)494-1000.</p>\n\n<p>In cases where a child has received or is receiving welfare, federal law allows the DCSS to obtain a court order for child support back to the date the child first started receiving welfare, subject to a three year retroactive limit before the date DCSS filed the Complaint (lawsuit) with the court. Effective 1/1/2000, new California law allows DCSS to go back only one year prior to filing the Complaint for a welfare reimbursement (child support) order.</p>\n\n<p>Many parents incorrectly believe they are being sued by DCSS to pay back the amount of the welfare the other parent and/or the child received. This is wrong. The law requires that the court make an order for the amount of guideline child support that the \"absent parent\" (or non-custodial parent) should have been paying during the time that the child received welfare and the non-custodial parent was not living with (and contributing to the support of) the child. A child's receipt of welfare will trigger a child support lawsuit brought by DCSS against the non-custodial parent.</p>\n\n<p>DCSS has special enforcement (collection) powers to collect child support. If any arrears (back support) are owed, DCSS can suspend a non-paying parent's drivers', professional or recreational license and/or suspend a passport. DCSS can intercept (take) a non-paying parent's state and federal tax refunds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sometimes each parent is asked to pay child support</h3>\n\nIf a child is not in the custody of either parent and the child receives welfare, DCSS will sue each parent in order to obtain a child support order. This happens when a child is in a group home, foster care, or living with a relative or other caretaker and receiving welfare. If the parents do not live together, they will be sued separately by DCSS and their child support obligation will be determined independent of the other parent's ability to pay child support as calculated under the guideline.\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"6\"></a><h2>Child Support Modifications</h2>\n\nChild support cannot be modified (changed) for periods of time in the past (after an order has been made but before a \"paying\" or non-custodial parent makes a court request to reduce the amount of support, or before the \"receiving\" or custodial parent makes a court request to increase the amount of support). In other words, the court-ordered child support figure continues in effect until the court later modifies it and makes a new order. Usually, the earliest effective date for a modification is the date a parent files or serves a motion (a request for a court order) requesting a modification.\n\n<p>A parent who feels the need to have the child support order modified because of a change in circumstances since the last order was made needs to file a modification request in a timely manner. Under California law, child support is modifiable any time a parent can show the court that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the last order was made. If a parent believes there is such a change in circumstances, that parent needs to bring the new information to the court's attention right away (by filing a motion for modification) in order to obtain a new order that takes effect right away.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"7\"></a><h2>Interest on Child Support</h2>\n\nInterest at the legal rate (currently 10 per cent per year) is owed on all unpaid child support (called back support, or \"arrears\"). The interest does not compound, meaning interest does not build up on the interest, but it accrues on the principal amount owed only (the child support amount ordered). Left unpaid, the amount of support arrears owed over time grows to sometimes astronomical numbers once the interest is added on. California law gives judicial officers no power to waive or adjust arrears that have accrued, or the interest that has accrued on those arrears.\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"8\"></a><h2>Duration of a Child Support Order</h2>\n\nA California support obligation ends, normally, when the child turns 18. If the child is 18 but still residing at home, still attending high school full-time and still not self-supporting, then the child support obligation ends when the child graduates high school or turns 19, whichever comes first. The court may extend the duration of child support if an adult child is disabled. Parents can agree on their own to extend the duration of a child support order.\n\n<p>Any arrears continue to be owed until paid in full, regardless of the child's age. Arrears means that there was a valid court order that support be paid, but the parent ordered to pay support did not pay some or all of the support while the obligation continued.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"9\"></a><h2>Health Insurance</h2>\n\nCalifornia law requires both parents to provide health insurance coverage for their child if such coverage is available at no cost or at reasonable cost. What is a \"reasonable\" cost is different from case to case.\n\n<p>Parents who do not have health insurance coverage for their child should look into the state program called HEALTHY FAMILIES. For more information and/or for an application, you can contact 1-800-880-5305 Monday through Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM.</p>\n\n<p>Both parents are also required to share a child's uninsured health care expenses (out-of-pocket or unreimbursed expenses such as co-payments) equally if an order is in place that requires parents to share such expenses. This means that if a child has orthodontia (braces) and the uninsured cost will be $1000.00, each parent will be required to pay $500.00 as long as there is an order in place that requires the parents to share such an uninsured expense. Make sure you request this order from the court so it applies in your case.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"10\"></a><h2>Spousal Support</h2>\n\nSpouses can request that the court make a spousal support order as part of a divorce or separation case. Spousal support is a discretionary order, meaning the court has great freedom in determining what amount of support, if any, should be paid in a particular case, and for how long spousal support should be paid.\n\n<p>At the \"temporary\" stage of a case, meaning from the time the divorce or separation case is filed up until the time a final Judgment is entered, the court often uses the support guideline (see above discussion on child support for guideline factors) to determine what amount of spousal support should be paid. The court is not required to order the guideline amount. The guideline amount is based on each spouse's income, tax filing status, and certain allowed deductions such as health insurance and union dues.</p>\n\n<p>At the \"permanent\" stage of a case, meaning after a final Judgment of separation or divorce has been entered, the court must consider certain statutory factors in deciding (1) what amount of spousal support to order, if any; and (2) the duration (how many months or years) of the order. The court considers factors such as the age and health of the spouses, the length of the marriage, and each spouse's job skills. See Family Code section 4320 for more information. Unless a court has reason not to do so, \"permanent\" spousal support will usually have duration of half the length of the marriage, measured from date of marriage through date of separation.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike child support, spousal support is tax deductible to the spouse paying it (only those payments made after a court order is in place are tax deductible), and the spouse collecting it must claim the amount received in any given tax year as taxable income.</p>\n\n<p>Spousal support terminates per court order, or naturally by the death of either spouse or the remarriage of the supported spouse. If you want the court to modify or terminate a court order for spousal support, you will need to file and serve a motion to request a modification or termination unless the order itself has a built-in modification amount and/ or termination date.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"11\"></a><h2>Child Custody and Visitation</h2>\n\n<h3>Petition for Custody and Visitation</h3>\n\nhis action may be filed by married or unmarried parents to obtain custody and support orders without filing a dissolution of marriage/legal separation or nullity action, if the parents of the minor children are married, or without filing an action to establish a parental relationship, if the parents of the minor children are unmarried. This action is limited and can only be used in certain situations by a married or unmarried parent. This action does not deal with property or marital status, if the parents are married, or establish a parental relationship, if the parents are unmarried. To address these other issues, the married parents would need to file an action requesting dissolution of marriage/legal separation or nullity action. Unmarried parents need to file an action to establish the parental relationship.\n\n<p>Before parents can address the issues of custody and visitation of their minor children, there must be an underlying action. If the parents are married, either the mother or the father must first file an action requesting dissolution of marriage, legal separation, nullity or file the petition for custody and support of minor children's action. If the parents are unmarried, either the mother or the father must file an action to establish the parental relationship or file the petition for custody and support of minor children. Once an underlying action has been filed, the Court can address the issues of custody and visitation.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of custody, and the court needs to make orders concerning each type.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li><strong>Legal custody</strong> means which parent will have decision-making power over the child's health, education and welfare issues. The court can order that the parents have joint legal custody (meaning they have equal decision-making power), or the court can order that one parent have sole legal custody (the only right to make decisions about the child).</li>\n\n\t<li><strong>Physical custody</strong> means where (with which parent) the child will primarily reside. A court can order that both parents have significant time with the child. This can be called \"joint custody\". The court could instead order that one parent will have physical custody, and the other parent will have visitation.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The legal standard that the court uses to determine what type of custody orders to make in your case is the best interests of the child. This is a flexible standard that allows each family's and each child's needs to be considered. In determining what is in the best interests of the child, the court may consider the health, safety and welfare of the child, the nature and amount of the child's contact with both parents, the habitual or continual illegal use of controlled substances or alcohol by either parent, and/or any history of abuse by one parent against any related child, against the other parent and/or against any person with which the parent has been romantically involved. It is the public policy of the state of California that a child will have frequent and continuing contact with each parent, unless such contact is deemed not be in the child's best interests.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"12\"></a><h2>Establishing Parentage (Paternity)</h2>\n\nThis action is filed by an unmarried mother or by an unmarried father who have minor children together.

Once the default is entered, the Petitioner can complete the paternity proceeding without the participation of the Respondent.</p>\n\n<p>If the Respondent files the necessary responding paperwork, the case will then proceed as either a contested matter or an uncontested matter. The action is considered contested if the parties are unable to agree on some or all issues and the Court must resolve the unresolved issues. The action is considered uncontested if the parties are able to cooperate and agree on all issues outside of Court and the matter can proceed to its conclusion by submitting the necessary signed paperwork for the Court's signature.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"13\"></a><h2>Termination of a Marriage</h2>\n\n<h3>Dissolution</h3>\n\nThere are three different ways to terminate a marriage.  The most common is dissolution of marriage (often referred to as divorce). There are only two grounds used for obtaining dissolution, either \"irreconcilable differences\" or \"incurable insanity.\" Most dissolution cases request an end to the marriage based on irreconcilable differences. California court is a \"no-fault\" state, which means the court does not need to find that one spouse is at fault for the breakdown of the marriage. The existence of irreconcilable differences provides the court with the grounds to make a divorce or separation Judgment.\n\n<p>A marriage may be dissolved on the grounds of incurable insanity \" . . . only upon proof, including competent medical or psychiatric testimony, that the insane person was insane at the time the petition was filed, and remains incurably insane\" (Family Code Section 2312).</p>\n\n<p>To file for dissolution, either you or your spouse must meet California's residency requirements. Either you or your spouse must have lived in California for at least six (6) months prior to filing your case AND either you or your spouse must have lived in the county where you will be filing the dissolution case for at least three (3) months prior to filing your case. There can be situations where both parties reside in California for at least six (6) months but they lived in different counties for the last three (3) months. In this situation, a party can elect to file in either county. The court you file in is the court that handles your dissolution case unless both parties have moved from the county and have formally obtained a change in venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Legal Separation</h3>\n\nYou do not have to meet any of the above residency requirements to request either a legal separation or a nullity of marriage. Most parties choose dissolution rather than a legal separation. Dissolution divides property and debts, makes orders regarding child custody, child support and spousal support, and terminates the marriage (restoring the parties to the status of unmarried persons).\n\n<p>Parties may choose to formally separate their lives but remain married for religious or other personal reasons (i.e., maintain medical insurance, qualify for derivative social security benefits). Both parties must agree to a request for legal separation. If one party files documentation requesting a legal separation and the other party file documentation requesting dissolution, the judge will grant the dissolution. If the marriage ends with the judge granting a Judgment for Legal Separation, either party may file a separate dissolution case to terminate the martial status to return both parties to the status of unmarried persons.</p>\n\n<p>If you desire dissolution but neither you nor your spouse meets California's residency requirements, you may initiate a case requesting a legal separation. Once either party meets the residency requirements, you can amend the Petition form to request dissolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nullity</h3>\n\nA nullity of marriage (sometimes referred to as an annulment) is rarely used. If the judge grants a nullity of marriage, it is as if the marriage never legally existed and restores the parties to the status of unmarried persons. Certain conditions must be met before the Court will find the marriage void (Family Code Sections 2200-2201) or voidable (Family Code Sections 2210) and grant a nullity of marriage.\n\n<p>Further, the conditions for nullity of marriage must have existed at the time of the marriage. There are time limits, which will prevent you from raising the issue of a voidable marriage. Time limits vary but are generally four years after the date of the marriage. Once these time limits have passed, you will need to end the marriage and resolve issues by requesting either a dissolution or legal separation. Even though the marriage is considered invalid, depending on the facts of the case, you may still be treated like a spouse for the purposes of property and debt division, custody and support as if the marriage had been valid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Process of Terminating a Marriage</h3>\n\nThe process of divorce begins when you file your initial papers.  Before your dissolution is complete, all the issues must be resolved, either by default, agreement or through contested court proceedings.  Each case is different.  The process may take several months if the case is uncontested, or it could take years if there are a lot of disputes or complex issues.\n\n\n\n<h3>Do not assume that you are divorced until there is a judgment filed and entered by the court</h3>\n\nA person is able to remarry only after the Judgment has been entered terminating marital status.  The earliest possible date upon which marital status can be terminated is 6 months and 1 day after the Respondent was served with the Petition and Summons for dissolution.  However, in many cases, it takes much longer than this to bring the case to final Judgment.\n\n<p>It is important to know that you will not receive a Judgment of divorce automatically. You will not receive a divorce Judgment just by filing and serving a Summons and Petition, or just by filing and serving a Response. Even if the no response is filed your divorce is not final.  You must take additional steps.  In most cases, you and your spouse will either need to negotiate, prepare and file with the court a MARITAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT and some related forms, or if you cannot agree, set the case for trial, present your evidence, receive orders and then prepare and file the Judgment according to the court's orders. In some cases known as \"true default cases\", where Respondent never files a Response and the spouses do not have a Marital Settlement Agreement, it is possible for Petitioner to get a final Judgment of divorce without Respondent needing to be involved.</p>\n\n<p>Do not assume that you are divorced until you have seen a file-stamped Judgment from the court that says you are divorced. Remember, this will not happen automatically - you and/or your spouse must continually work the case through to the Judgment stage. You are not free to remarry until you are divorced.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<h3>Common Questions</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>May I serve papers in my own case?</strong><br>\n\nNo, you can not serve papers in your own case.  Anyone over the age of eighteen (18) who is not a party to the action can serve papers on the other side.  \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>When is my divorce final?</strong><br>\n\nThe earliest date your marital status can terminate is six months and 1 day from the day your spouse is served with papers or files a response, whichever is earlier.  Please note that after initial paperwork is filed you need to file various other papers with the court in order for marriage status to terminate.  Termination of marriage does not happen automatically once initial paperwork is filed and six months from service/first appearance has passed.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>How are property issues resolved in a divorce or separation case?</strong><br>\n\nProperty issues and division of community assets and debts are ordinarily resolved by a signed marital settlement agreement or by an agreement placed on the record (and later formalized in writing) at a mandatory settlement conference.  If settlement is not reached, contested issues are set for trial for court determination.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>How do I schedule trial dates and/or a settlement conference for my divorce or separation case?</strong><br>\n\nOnce a petition and response is on file, trial dates and settlement conferences can be obtained by filing an At Issue Memorandum.\n\n</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"14\"></a><h2>Community Property and Separate Property Defined</h2>\n\nTo be able to characterize your assets or debts as community or separate, it helps to know what your \"date of separation\" is. The date of separation is generally defined as that date you knew the marriage was irremediably broken. This means the date at which at least one spouse knew there was no hope for saving the marriage. For some people, this may be the date you moved out, or the date you filed for divorce.\n\n<p>Community property is generally defined as assets acquired through a spouse's time, labor and skills, from date of marriage through and including date of separation. Community property is usually everything that a married couple own together (title to certain assets does not have to be in both spouses' names in order to be considered community property), such as money that you now have which either spouse earned during the time they were living together as husband and wife, or anything either spouse bought with money earned during that time period. Community property can be things like a car, a house, a security deposit on an apartment, a 401(k) account, a pension, a bank account, home furnishings, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Community debts are generally defined as the debts that a husband and wife owe together. In most cases, that includes anything you still owe on any debts either of you took on during the time you were living together as husband and wife.</p>\n\n<p>California law requires that the spouses divide community property and debts equally. To equalize the division of assets and debts, one spouse may get more assets because they also got more debts. Spouses can agree to divide assets and debts unequally if they would like.</p>\n\n<p>Separate property is generally defined as everything that a husband and wife own or owe (if it is a debt) separately. It includes assets acquired, or debts incurred, before date of marriage or after date of separation. It also includes any assets acquired by the spouse during the marriage by gift (to that spouse alone) or inheritance. California law requires that separate property assets or debts be confirmed to the spouse who acquired or incurred them. Family law attorneys can be extremely helpful with property and debt issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mandatory Disclosure</h3>\n\nCalifornia law requires spouses in a divorce or separation case to provide each other with forms to disclose assets and debts, and income and expenses. This is to help each spouse develop information about the \"marital estate\" - what property and debt issues there are. This in turn helps prepare the case for final Judgment.\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"15\"></a><h2>Domestic Violence Restraining Orders</h2>\n\nDomestic violence temporary restraining order forms, information sheets and fee waiver packets are available at the Family Law Clerk's Office, Family Law Facilitator's Office or at Centro De Recursos Legales.

Under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, abuse is defined as any of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury.</li>\n\n\t<li>Sexual assault.</li>\n\n\t<li>Placing a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.</li>\n\n\t<li>Engaging in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined such as molesting, attacking, striking, stalking, threatening, battering, harassing, telephoning, destroying personal property, contacting the other by mail or otherwise, disturbing the peace of the other party.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The act(s) of abuse/violence must be recent, within thirty days, and the batterer must be a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, ex-boyfriend/ex-girlfriend, someone with whom the victim has or has had a dating relationship, an immediate family member (mother, father, in-laws, siblings, adult children), or a person with whom a party has a child/ren together. A victim that is a target of abuse but does not have the necessary relationship to the batterer may file a civil harassment restraining order, discussed below.</p>\n\n<p>The restraining order can include the following: restraints on personal conduct by the batterer; orders for the batterer to stay-away from the victim's home/work and/or children's school; orders for the batterer to be removed from the residence; child custody and visitation and support orders and other miscellaneous orders.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#top\"><img src=\"/_images/icon_top.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n<td><img src=\"/_images/blank.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><a class=\"top_link\" href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a name=\"16\"></a><h2>Civil Harassment</h2>\n\nCivil harassment restraining order forms, information sheets and fee waiver packets are available at most of the Courthouses including the Facilitator's Office and Centro De Recursos Legales.

Harassment is defined as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Unlawful violence.</li>\n\n\t<li>A credible threat of violence or</li>\n\n\t<li>A knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person and that serves no legitimate purpose.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 527.6(b), the course of conduct must be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and must actually cause substantial emotional distress to the victim.</p>\n\n<p>The restraining order can include restraints on personal conduct by the batterer, order the batterer to stay away from the victim's home/work and/or children's school, and other miscellaneous orders. There is no requirement that there be a relationship between the victim and a batterer in order to obtain the protective order.
