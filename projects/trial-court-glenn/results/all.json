{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <h2>What Do Mediators Do? </h2>\r\n          <p> A mediator meets with both parents, listens to each of you, and then works with you so you can come up with a plan you can both agree is best for your child. The mediator's job is to be impartial, keep things fair, help you look at different options, help you come up with a calendar for times with the children, and support you in your efforts. </p>\r\n          <h2> Mediation Rules</h2>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Each parent is treated with respect and has an equal chance to explain his or her viewpoint and concerns. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent listens to the other and tries to find realistic solutions. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to put the children first and focus on what the children need and can handle.</li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to show respect for the other and to recognize that their child has a right to a relationship with each of them. </li>\r\n            <li>Hitting, pushing, shoving, and threats of any type are not allowed and considered domestic violence. Mediation is to be a safe place for both parents. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p>The mediator's job is to see that these rules are followed. </p>\r\n          <h2>If There Has Been Domestic Violence </h2>\r\n          <p>If you or a family member has any concerns about domestic violence, please do three things:</p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Tell your lawyer if you have one. </li>\r\n            <li>Answer all of the questions from the judge or mediation intake person about this problem. </li>\r\n            <li>Talk to your mediator about this problem at the beginning of the mediation session. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p><strong>KEEP IN MIND:</strong> The course of your session with the mediator can be determined by whether you have a domestic violence restraining order in effect and whether there has been a history of domestic violence between you and the other parent. In these cases, you have a right, subject to certain limitations, to have a support person with you during mediation and in the courtroom.

{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <p>The juvenile court is a division of the superior court. It handles two types of cases: </p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Delinquency: These cases involve children who have committed law violations that would be considered crimes if committed by an adult. </li>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Dependency: These are cases that concern family situations where allegations of abuse or neglect have been made and the juvenile court intervenes to protect the family\u2019s children. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <h2>The Court\u2019s Authority </h2>\r\n          <p>The juvenile court has broad authority in juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. It can remove children from their homes, order their placement with relatives or in foster care or group homes, terminate parental rights, create new parental rights, and join various agencies to provide needed services. In delinquency cases, the juvenile court can also order children to be confined in locked facilities, including the California Youth Authority. </p>\r\n          <p>Whenever the court decides to remove a child from his or her home, placement and responsibility for that child is given to a governmental agency. It can also order services to be provided that will allow children to remain in their homes safely. In delinquency and status offense cases, that agency is the probation department; in dependency (abuse and neglect) cases, the agency is the county welfare department. The agency is responsible for meeting the health and educational needs of the child, as well as providing the care, treatment, and guidance the child may need.</p>\r\n          <h2>Legal Help </h2>\r\n          <p>Because these decisions are so serious and affect fundamental rights, it is very important that, if a juvenile case involves you or your child, you consult an attorney who can advise you more specifically about the court process as it relates to your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Your Right to an Attorney </h2>\r\n          <p>The child in a delinquency case has a right to an attorney; a parent in a dependency (abuse and neglect) case has a right to an attorney; and the court must appoint an attorney for the child in an abuse and neglect case unless the court finds the child would not benefit from the appointment.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Juvenile Court"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/juvenile.shtml"},

The judge will also tell you what the trial is about. </p>\r\n                      <p>Next, the judge and the attorneys will question each of the people in the jury box to find out if you can be fair and impartial in this particular case. </p>\r\n                      <p>One of the attorneys may \u201cchallenge you for cause.\u201d This means the attorney will ask the judge to excuse you from the jury for a specific legal reason. </p>\r\n                      <p>Each lawyer has an unlimited number of challenges for cause.\r\n                        \r\n                        Each attorney has the right to a certain number of peremptory challenges.

You should not guess or speculate about things not discussed in court, but you can draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence presented.</p>\r\n                      <p>It is important to take the case you are deciding seriously. After all, if you were a party in the case, it would be important to you, and you would want the jury to give it serious consideration even if the controversy appears less significant to others. </p>\r\n                      <p>All jurors should deliberate and vote on each issue to be decided in the case. When it is time to count votes, it is the foreperson's duty to see that this is done properly. In a civil case, the judge will tell you how many jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict. In a criminal case, the unanimous agreement of all 12 jurors is required. If the required number of jurors agree on each issue to be decided, the foreperson will sign and date the verdict, advise the bailiff or court attendant, and return with the signed verdict and any unsigned verdict forms from prior votes to the courtroom. </p>\r\n                      <p>If a jury cannot arrive at a verdict within a reasonable time and indicates to the judge that there is no possibility that they can reach a verdict, the judge, in his or her discretion, may dismiss the jury. This situation is a mistrial, sometimes referred to as a \"hung jury,\" and may mean the case goes to trial again with a new jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>When you have reached a verdict the foreperson will record your verdict on an official form. The bailiff will tell the judge you are ready and you will return to the jury box. The judge will ask if you reached a verdict. The foreperson will answer, handing the written verdict to the bailiff who in turn will hand it to the judge. The clerk will read the verdict aloud. Sometimes one of the parties will ask that the jury be polled. This means that the clerk will ask each juror if this is his or her own verdict. The jury service will then be complete. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Three Main Steps of a Jury Trial</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> California juries have been providing outstanding service and have set a high standard. The state of California and your trial judge thank you and all jurors for giving generously of your time and for taking jury service seriously.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 1: Selection of a Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>When a jury trial is about to begin, the trial court judge requests a panel of prospective jurors to be sent to the courtroom from the jury assembly room so that the jury selection process can begin. After reporting to a courtroom, the prospective jurors are first required to swear that they will truthfully answer all questions asked about their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>The perjury admonishment, which basically requires potential jurors to tell the truth when answering the questions, is read as follows: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will accurately and truthfully answer, under penalty of perjury, all questions propounded to you concerning your qualifications and competency to serve as a trial juror in the matter pending before this court, and that failure to do so may subject you to criminal prosecution? </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>The court clerk calls 12 or more jurors to take seats in the jury box. The judge speaks to the jurors, telling them the names of the people involved in the case and their attorneys and stating what the case is about. The judge and the attorneys ask jurors questions to determine if the jurors are free of bias (prejudice) or whether there is any reason why any of them cannot be fair and impartial; this process is called voir dire. It is important to ask questions if you do not understand a question. Also, each juror is obligated to follow the law as explained by the judge; if you cannot follow the law, you need to let the judge know.</p>\r\n                      <p>The law lets the judge and the lawyers excuse individual jurors from service in a particular case for various reasons. If a lawyer wants to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" to excuse the juror. Challenges can be for cause or peremptory. There are two types of juror challenges: a challenge for cause and a peremptory challenge. The process of questioning and excusing jurors continues until 12 persons are accepted as jurors for the trial. Alternate jurors may also be selected. The judge and attorneys agree that these jurors are qualified to decide impartially and intelligently the factual issues in the case. When the selection of the jury is completed, the jurors take the following oath: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court, and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court?\" </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>As a juror you should think seriously about the oath before taking it. The oath means you give your word to reach your verdict upon only the evidence presented in the trial and the court's instructions about the law. You cannot consider any other evidence or instruction other than those given by the court in the case before you. Remember that your role as a juror is as important as the judge's in making sure that justice is done. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 2: The Trial </h2>\r\n                      <h3>Jurors' duties during the trial: </h3>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not </strong>talk to others about the case. This responsibility requires that you not talk at all with the lawyers, witnesses, or anyone else connected with the case. The lawyers understand this rule. You will find that, even at the risk of seeming rude or unfriendly, the lawyers must avoid even casual conversation with you. In order to prevent even the appearance of improper conversation, a wise policy for you to follow is to avoid any contact with the lawyers or the parties. You also cannot talk to anybody about the case. There are important reasons for this: all cases must be decided only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you were to discuss the facts of the case or your impressions of it with your family, friends, or with any other person, you might hear their ideas and might be influenced by people who do not know all the facts. If you believe that someone has tried to speak to you about the case, you must report what happened to the judge by contacting the bailiff immediately. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> make up your mind before hearing all the evidence. It is also your duty not to form or express an opinion about the case to anyone. This means that you keep an open mind until you have heard the evidence from all sides and the case is given to the jury for deliberation. Only then may you discuss it with your fellow jurors and even then only when all jurors are present. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> conduct your own investigation of the case. It would also be a violation of your duty as a juror to conduct any investigation of the case. As a juror you must not become an amateur detective. For example, you must not visit the scene of an accident, an alleged crime, or any event or transaction involved in the case. You should not conduct experiments or consult any other person or reference works for additional information. If the judge feels that an inspection of a place is necessary or will be helpful, he or she will arrange and supervise an inspection by the whole jury. If you have a question about the evidence, let the judge know by handing a note to the bailiff and he or she will make a decision about your question. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Attorneys' opening statements</strong>: As the trial begins, the lawyer for the plaintiff in a civil case or the prosecutor in a criminal case may make an opening statement telling you what they expect the evidence to show. The defendant's lawyer may also choose to give an opening statement after the plaintiff's attorney or prosecutor, telling you what the defense expects the evidence to show. The lawyers' statements are not evidence. Their purpose is to give you the framework of the case, the points of conflict, and the issues of the case that you will need to decide. Be careful that you do not let any of the information presented in the opening statements become evidence in your mind. Remember that the lawyers' statements are only their versions of what happened, not evidence. </p>\r\n                      <p> <strong>Presentation of evidence</strong>: Evidence may be presented by the attorneys in the form of a written document or an object (a gun, another weapon, a photograph, an x-ray, or some other physical thing). These are called exhibits. Evidence may also include the testimony of witnesses under oath in the courtroom.\r\n                        \r\n                        Attorneys' closing statements: After all the evidence has been reviewed in court, lawyers for each side may present their final summary of the case, sometimes referred to as an argument. The lawyers can talk about reasons and make conclusions, but these are not evidence; they are efforts to persuade you. You should listen to these statements carefully and consider them thoughtfully, but you must form your own opinion about the outcome of the case based upon all evidence presented. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Judge's Instructions on the Law</strong>: Either before or after the closing arguments by the lawyers, the judge will explain the law that applies to the case to you. This is the judge's instruction to the jury. You have to apply that law to the facts, as you have heard them, in arriving at your verdict. You must consider all of the instructions and give them equal consideration. Keep in mind that you must follow the law as the judge states it to you. If the judge gives you an instruction that seems different from what you read here or another instruction given at another trial, you must accept the instruction given by the judge of the case you are deciding as correct and be guided by the judge's statement only. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>When considering the evidence</strong>, an important difference exists between civil and criminal cases in the degree of proof required to sustain an accusation. In a criminal case, the defendant, in order to be convicted, must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, a party suing another has to prove that charge by a preponderance of the evidence. In every trial, the judge carefully explains the degree of proof required to reach a verdict. You should pay careful attention to the instructions on the degree of proof. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 3: Deliberations by the Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>After closing statements by the attorneys and the judge's instructions on the law, the bailiff or court attendant will take you to the jury room for deliberations. Your first duty when entering the jury room is to select a foreperson. The jury should carefully select a well-qualified foreperson. The foreperson's duty is to see that discussion happens in a free and orderly manner, that the issues you must decide are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given an opportunity to participate. </p>\r\n                      <p>After you enter the jury room for deliberations, the exhibits that you are to consider are given to you. If you are not given written instruction from the judge on the law, you may request them. If you feel you need further instructions or to have certain testimony read back to you, inform the judge through the bailiff or the court attendant. Since these purposes can be accomplished only by returning everyone (including parties and lawyers) to the courtroom, you should not make these requests lightly. The procedure usually takes time, but this delay is understandable if you seriously believe doing so is necessary or helpful to you in reaching a verdict. There is a booklet, \"Behind Closed Doors\" that can assist jurors with the format of their deliberation. It is published by the American Judicature Society, which can be contacted at <a href=\"http://www.ajs.org\">http://www.ajs.org</a>. </p>\r\n                      <p>Quite often in the jury room the jurors may argue and have a difference of opinion. When this occurs, each juror should try to express his or her opinion and the reasoning supporting it. It would be wrong for a juror to refuse to listen to the arguments and opinions of the others or to deny another juror the right to express an opinion. Remember that jurors are not advocates, but impartial judges of the facts. By carefully considering each juror's opinion and the reasons behind it, it is usually possible for the jurors to reach a verdict. A juror should not hesitate to change his or her mind when there is a good reason. But each juror should maintain his or her position unless conscientiously persuaded to change that opinion by the other jurors. Following a full and free discussion with fellow jurors, each juror should vote only according to his or her own honest convictions. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">General Information</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li> <strong>Restrooms</strong> are located in the hallway in the Orland Branch and on the second floor of the courthouse in Willows. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Public Telephones</strong> are located in the hallway at the Orland Branch and across the street in Memorial Hall in Willows.</li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Children, relatives or friends</strong> are not permitted. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror Eligibility:</strong> All U.S. citizens who are over the age of 18, a resident of the county that issued the jury summons, and are able to understand the English language are eligible to serve on a jury in the State of California. Of these people, only convicted felons, meaning anyone who has been found guilty of a serious crime and are on probation, cannot serve. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror summons</strong>: Once you have received a jury summons, read the instructions carefully. If you have any questions, contact the jury office. Be sure to bring your summons with you when your report to court. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Term of Service</strong>: Jury service is a \"one day or one trial\" term of service. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you will serve for the duration of that one trial. Average length of a trial is two (2) to five (5) days, although trials can run longer. If you are not selected for a trial during your service day, your service obligation shall be complete for one year. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Compensation</strong>: California allows payment of $15 a day plus mileage, at the current rate according to federal standards, per mile one way for jury service. For reimbursement, ask your local jury office or the bailiff in the courtroom for more specific information for your local court. Although this is only a fraction of the cost of each juror's time, the courts are working with the Legislature and the Governor to increase juror fees. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There is ample parking at both courthouse locations. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Security</strong>: People entering the courthouse may be searched. Purses, briefcases, or other containers may also be searched. Weapons are prohibited in the courthouse facility. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Postponements</strong>: By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Orientation</strong>: You will be instructed regarding your jury service when you first appear. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Job and School</strong>: Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. This is the law. Section 230 of the California Labor Code is intended to prevent any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service and who has given reasonable notice of when the employee is to serve. Notice is generally considered reasonable if it is given as soon as possible once the employee has been summoned. The California Education Code (\u00a7\u00a7 44037 and 8 7036) and Rule of Court 5.5(d)(7) protect teachers, other school employees, and students as well. If you are harassed or fired, contact your local jury office or the judge assigned to your trial. If your employer has harassed you because of your service on a jury, contact the Department of Industrial Relation's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. You must complete a complaint form and turn it in to the Labor Board within six months from when the harassment happened. Remember to keep any certificate issued by the court clerk to prove that you served and for your employer's records. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Excuses for Undue Hardship</strong>: In certain serious cases, the jury commissioner or the judge may excuse you for up to one year. These are called undue hardship cases. If you have a personal situation that stops you from being able to serve, write that reason on your summons and mail it back or call the jury office. When listing reasons such as medical, job, or dependent care issues, be prepared to provide documentation to receive a postponement and not an excuse. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Disqualification</strong>: A person is disqualified or temporarily excused if he or she is a felon, nonresident, non-citizen, under a conservatorship, or in some cases, a peace officer. If you fall into one of these categories, contact the jury office to explain your situation. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Although we attempt to make jury service as convenient and efficient as possible, jurors should be advised that there will be times you will spend waiting. You may wish to bring something to occupy your time. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n              <!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>", "<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n\t<h2>Public Notice: Jury Scam Alert\u00a0 \u00a0</h2>\r\n\t<p style=\"background:#efefef;color:#C3070A;font-weight:600;border:3px solid #C3070A;padding:20px;font-size:14px;\">The jury staff of the Superior Court of California, County of Glenn will never ask past or\r\n\tprospective jurors for financial details, credit card numbers, bank account or personal\r\n\tinformation like Social Security numbers.

An unlawful detainer proceeding is an accelerated method for recovery of possession of leased premises. It is a limited proceeding designed to permit a landlord to recover possession of real property from a tenant who is wrongfully in possession. (Because of its summary character, an unlawful detainer action is not a suitable vehicle for trying complicated ownership issues involving allegations of fraud.) </p>\r\n          <p> Like civil actions generally, unlawful detainer actions are initiated by the filing of a complaint, issuance of a summons, and service of the complaint and summons on the defendant.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Landlords in California must first follow all requirements for eviction proceedings prescribed in California statutes and follow any applicable local ordinances. </p>\r\n          <h3>Three-day and 30-day notice</h3>\r\n          <p>An unlawful detainer proceeding is usually initiated by the landlord's serving a 3-day or 30-day notice on the tenant. A landlord must strictly comply with the statutory requirements for service of the notice to quit the leased premises. \r\n            \r\n            Among 3-day notices are notices to quit (\"leave\"), notices to perform covenant or quit, and notices to pay rent or quit. Three-day notices to quit are used when a tenant has allegedly breached (\"broken\") a covenant (\"agreement\") in the lease that cannot be cured. A 3-day notice to perform covenant or quit is used when there has been a curable breach other than nonpayment of rent, for example, breach of a covenant not to assign or sublet the premises. The most common notice is a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. </p>\r\n          <p>A landlord\u2019s choice to declare a forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement on a 3-day notice is nullified and the lease or rental agreement remains in effect if the tenant performs within 3 days after service of the notice or if the landlord waives the breach after service of the notice. </p>\r\n          <p>A 30-day notice to quit usually addresses a situation in which the landlord wishes to terminate an indefinite-term tenancy (that is, a holdover tenant or a tenant on a month-to-month tenancy). The landlord and tenant may provide by agreement at the time the tenancy is created that either party may terminate the tenancy on less than 30 days\u2019 notice, but the agreement may not provide for less than 7 days\u2019 notice. </p>\r\n          <p>No notice is required for an unlawful detainer action based on the expiration of a fixed-term tenancy, nor is notice required when a tenant occupies the property as part of his or her employment (for example, as an apartment manager), which has been terminated. </p>\r\n          <h3>Filing a complaint</h3>\r\n          <p>After you have complied with applicable notice requirements, the residential eviction process is begun by filing a complaint with the local court. To file a complaint, you may use Complaint Unlawful Detainer (Form 982.1(90)) and file the form with the local court, paying the applicable filing fee. </p>\r\n          <h3>Obtaining and serving the summons</h3>\r\n          <p>You then obtain a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) from the local court and must serve the summons on the tenant, adhering to appropriate service requirements. </p>\r\n          <h2>Tenant Requirements </h2>\r\n          <p>Responding to the complaint. As a tenant, if you are served with a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) and complaint concerning an eviction, you must respond to the summons. You may use Judicial Council Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer, to respond and must file the answer form with the local court that issued the summons. You must also pay a filing fee when filing the answer form, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. </p>\r\n          <p>Download fee waiver forms and instructions by clicking on the form number below:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a17.pdf\">982(a)(17)</a> Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a18.pdf\">982(a)(18)</a> Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>The following forms are used for later filings in your case: </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a20.pdf\">982(a)(20)</a> Application for Waiver of Additional Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a181.pdf\">982(a)(18.1)</a> Court Fees and Costs Order on Application for Waiver of Additional </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are confidential forms for the court. Do not have them served on the other party.</p>\r\n          <p>If there is more than one tenant, or defendant, listed in the complaint, each tenant must respond separately or a default judgment may be entered against the tenants who do not file an answer. Two tenants can share one answer form, but each must sign the answer form individually and pay a separate filing fee. If you are filing the answer for yourself only, put your name on line 1 of the answer form. If you are filing the answer for yourself and another tenant named in the complaint, put both your names on line 1. </p>\r\n          <p>Each tenant named in the complaint has five days after the summons is served to file an answer form at the court that issued the summons. (The five-day response time includes Saturdays and Sundays, but excludes all judicial holidays. If the last day for filing a response is a Saturday or Sunday, the tenant has until close of business on the next court day to file a response.) </p>\r\n          <p>A letter or phone call does not serve as a response. The answer must be on the proper legal form \u2014 Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer \u2014 in order for the court to hear the case.</p>\r\n          <p>If an answer is not filed on time, the tenant may lose the case, be evicted, and have his or her wages, money, and property taken by the landlord without further warning from the court. </p>\r\n          <p>The tenant\u2019s time to respond to a complaint for unlawful detainer is not affected by the tenant's quitting of the leased premises.</p>\r\n          <p>Serving the answer and completing a proof of service form: Before you file your answer with the court, you first have to make sure that a copy of the answer is served on the landlord of the property. This means that a copy of the answer along with a proof of service form must be given to the attorney for the landlord or, if the landlord is not represented by an attorney, to the landlord. It can be served by mail or hand delivered, but only by a person who is at least 18 years of age and is not a plaintiff or defendant in the case. </p>\r\n          <p> A Proof of Service form is used to show the court that a copy of your answer was sent to the other party in the case before you filed the original answer. It does not have to be received by the other party before you file; it must only be put in the mail. The Proof of Service must be signed by a person over 18 who is not a party to the case. This means that neither you, nor any other tenant in the case, can sign the Proof of Service form. You can obtain a Proof of Service form from your local superior court or from books containing general legal forms available from legal publishers or bookstores. </p>\r\n          <p> The court will not accept an answer for filing without a signed Proof of Service form attached. </p>\r\n          <p>You may want to call an attorney for assistance. If you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Landlord / Tenant / Unlawful Detainer"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/landlord-tenant.shtml"},

The grand jury concept has a long history and has adapted throughout the centuries to meet the needs and conditions of each time period. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p> Grand juries perform two primary roles. One is to evaluate the validity of charges being brought by a prosecutor, if the charges are not reviewed by a judge, to ensure that they are not frivolous or ungrounded. The other is to inquire into, and investigate if necessary, the operations of local government agencies and officials to ensure that activities are valid and services are efficiently and legally provided.

After the initial review, qualified applicants are scheduled for an interview with the Grand Jury Selection Committee. The Selection Committee is comprised of the Court\u2019s Judges, Executive Officer, and the incoming and outgoing Grand Jury forepersons.\r\n                        \r\n                        After the interviews, qualified prospective Grand Jurors are summoned to appear in court where all names are placed in a lottery draw. The first 19 names chosen become the next Glenn County Grand Jury. The remaining names are drawn to provide alternates.\r\n                        \r\n                        Shortly before the beginning of the term of service, July 1 through June 30, a training program is conducted for incoming Grand Jurors pursuant to PC \u00a7914(b). The foreperson is selected by the Presiding Judge.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h4>Commitment/Compensation </h4>\r\n                      <p>The complex, diverse responsibilities of grand jurors make it necessary to give a serious commitment to the time requirements. The usual work schedule is one to two evenings per month, although some day or weekend meetings may be required. However, each grand jury sets the dates and times of their meetings that is most convenient for all members. Jurors are provided with meeting facilities and parking, as well as a stipend. Reimbursement for the mileage to and from meetings is allowed at the regular county rate. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Application and Contact Information </h4>\r\n                      <p>For more information or a grand jury application, please write, email, or call:<br>\r\n                        \r\n                        Superior Court of California,                     County of Glenn<br>\r\n                        Office of the Jury Commissioner<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988<br>\r\n                        (530) 934-6382</p>\r\n                      <p> <a href=\"documents/Juror%20Questionnaire%209_2020.pdf\">Download the pdf version of the questionnaire here</a> If you are interested in participating in the Grand Jury process, please send a completed questionnaire to: </p>\r\n                      <p>Court Administrative Assistant<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">History of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> Before American Development </h4>\r\n                      <p> Some historians believe that the earliest versions of the grand jury existed in Athens, where the Greeks used citizen groups to develop accusations. Others find traces of the concept in all the Teutonic peoples, including early Anglo-Saxons. For example, the concept was employed in the early Scandinavian countries. Evidence also exists that the early French developed the \"King's Audit\" involving citizens who were sworn and required to provide fiscal information related to the operation of the kingdom.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>However, most commentators believe that the grand jury arose as an institution in England. In the first millennium, English individuals prosecuted criminals, with the king personally involved in the system. Under the Doom Law of Anglo-Saxon King Aethelred (980-1016), a dozen landowners were appointed to investigate alleged crimes. In 1166, King Henry II established a system of local informers (twelve men from every one hundred) to identify those who were \"suspected of\" various crimes. If the suspects survived their \"trials by ordeal\", they paid fines to the King. However, the \"informers\" were fined if they failed to indict any suspect, or even enough suspects. After 1188, they became tax collectors as well, and after the reign of Henry III, they were charged with looking into the condition and maintenance of public works. </p>\r\n                      <p> The Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215, did not mention the grand jury specifically, but did establish various procedures to ensure fairness in the dispensation of justice. Thereafter, until the mid-1300's, the 12-man juries served both to present indictments and also to rule on the validity of charges. During Edward III's reign, from 1312-1377, the 12 individuals were replaced by 24 knights, called \"le grande inquest\", and the 12 became a \"petit jury\" responsible only for declaring innocent or guilty verdicts. </p>\r\n                      <p> Ultimately, in the 1600's, the English grand jury developed as a process to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that an accused individual was guilty of a crime. Grand juries reached their English pinnacle of citizen protectors in 1681, when they refused to indict enemies of King Charles II for alleged crimes. (Ironically, English laws establishing grand juries were repealed in 1933.)</p>\r\n                      <h4>Early American Development</h4>\r\n                      <p>The use of juries in earliest colonial history was limited. In the New Haven colony, for example, religious beliefs resulted in the residents eliminating trial by jury because there was no reference to juries in the laws of Moses. However, procedures similar to grand juries were used to hear criminal charges of larceny (Boston, 1644), holding a disorderly meeting (Plymouth, 1651), and witchcraft (Pennsylvania, 1683). In the early 1600's, colonial representatives of the English monarchs made laws and prosecuted violators. The first grand juries recommended civil charges against those crown agents, thus establishing themselves as representatives of the governed, similar to grand juries today. The first grand juries also looked into government misconduct or neglect. For example, the first colonial grand jury, established in Massachusetts in 1635, \"presented\" town officials for neglecting to repair stocks, as well as considering cases of murder, robbery and spousal abuse. </p>\r\n                      <p>Other early grand juries performed a variety of administrative functions, including audits of county funds (New Jersey), inspections of public buildings (Carolinas), and review of taxes and public works (Virginia). Virginia grand juries also investigated whether each family planted two acres of corn per person.</p>\r\n                      <p>In the Colonies, grand juries were considering criminal accusations and investigating government officials and activities, but with a populist view. Grand jurors included popular leaders such as Paul Revere and John Hancock's brother. These grand juries played a critical role in the pre-Revolutionary period: for example, three grand juries refused to indict John Peter Zenger, whose newspaper criticized the royal governor's actions in New York (he ultimately was prosecuted by the provincial attorney, defended by Alexander Hamilton, and acquitted). Grand juries also denounced arbitrary royal intrusions on citizens' rights, refused to indict the leaders against the Stamp Act of 1765, and refused to bring libel charges against the editors of the Boston Gazette in 1766. </p>\r\n                      <p>After the Revolutionary War ended, the new federal constitution did not include a grand jury. Early American leaders such as John Hancock and James Madison objected. Thereafter, the grand jury was included in the Bill of Rights, as part of the Fifth Amendment, which states, \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger...\" </p>\r\n                      <p>From then, until today, the federal grand jury remains an integral part of the justice system, used by federal prosecutors for a variety of potential crimes. In 1801, a federal grand jury indicted Colonel Aaron Burr for treason. Most recently, federal grand juries considered allegations related to the Oklahoma City and New York Trade Center bombings, President Clinton's conduct both before and during his term of office, and the recent claims of wrong-doing by former California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and some associates. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Adaptation by the States </h4>\r\n                      <p>As the various states were admitted to the Union and adopted their legal and operating procedures, almost every one initially included some reliance on grand juries for either (or both) review of criminal indictments or inquiries into government activities. Some states' grand juries were very active in administrative affairs, even including recommending new laws. Others carried out investigations of government officials; one Tennessee grand jury indicted the entire state court of appeals and another opposed a judge's reappointment on the grounds of \"mental imbecility\". </p>\r\n                      <p>Throughout this state-by-state development, the underlying concept remained the same: ordinary citizens, neighbors, and others on grand juries were a necessary part of government to ensure that public prosecutors were not swayed by personal or political prejudices, and that government officials efficiently and effectively performed their jobs. </p>\r\n                      <p>Since the mid-1800's, grand juries have been criticized as ineffective or out-of-date by a number of reformers because they were slow, lacked expertise, and on other grounds. Others criticized the \"star chamber\" atmosphere of secret hearings without customary due process rights. However, these complaints were offset by effective grand jury investigations, including those of the Boss Tweed ring in New York City (1871) and racketeering charges brought by a grand jury assisted by Thomas Dewey in the 1930's. Since the nineteenth century, various minor and major changes have been made in grand jury selection, procedures, and qualifications, often resulting in fairer and more efficient jury operations. </p>\r\n                      <p>Today, all states except Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, may use grand juries to indict and begin criminal trials. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia require that grand jury indictments be used for certain-more serious-crimes. California and twenty-four other states make use of grand jury indictments optional. All states and the District of Columbia use grand juries for investigative purposes. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">The Grand Jury's Role</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Prosecutions </h4>\r\n                      <p>Although the American grand jury originally was conceived as a protector of ordinary citizens by other ordinary citizens, the fairness of its criminal operations has been questioned by various commentators and judges. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas stated, \"It is, indeed, common knowledge that the Grand Jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the Government, is now a tool of the Executive.\" Some even have referred to it as a \"rubber stamp\" for prosecutors. In the criminal system, the California constitution and laws provide that felony prosecutions are initiated only after a determination that there is \"probable cause\" to believe that specific individuals committed specific crimes. This is done either by \"information\" presented for examination and approval by a judge, or by indictment after a grand jury hearing and vote. In either case, the purpose of the objective review is to prevent overzealous prosecutors from unjustified, groundless, or unfair prosecutions when \"probable cause\" does not exist. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury operates without providing many fundamental rights common in court hearings and trials. For example, the defendant has neither the right to present evidence to the grand jury or cross-examine the witnesses against him or her. Only the prosecutor may present evidence, and the defendant has no right to counsel, even if required to testify. Even judges generally are excluded, leaving the grand jurors to rely on the prosecutor for all information. One early study indicated that 95% of all cases brought to the grand jury resulted in indictments, raising questions about the value of this review because the grand jury is not able to adequately evaluate the evidence presented only by the district attorney. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The role of the grand jury in civil investigations presents an interesting twist: the original (English) grand juries served to aid the government in finding and prosecuting private citizens' misdeeds; now, these juries investigate and accuse public figures, defending individual citizens' rights and expectations. Grand juries, both federal and state, may investigate criminal activity or non-criminal activities. In California, for example, the grand jury can investigate any activity by a public official (other than court), which violates a state law, and many other activities, as long as they occur within the county of the grand jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>State grand juries, but not federal grand juries, can investigate any non-criminal activity and report and make recommendations based on the results of the investigation. These investigations commonly include reviewing the operation and condition of jails and prisons, investigating the conduct of local public officials, and other similar matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The results of these investigations may be criminal charges, recommendations for new laws, or merely reports to the public identifying problems but proposing no specific solutions.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Duties of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <h4>\r\n                            \r\n                      Government Watchdog</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In California today, provisions of the Penal Code to require the grand jury:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Investigate and report on the accounts, records, operations, and functions of district, city and county government and public officials (Penal Code \u00a7 925 &amp; 925a); it may also inquire into the affairs of joint powers agencies located in the county. </li>\r\n  <li>Inquire into the condition and management of all correctional facilities within the county (Penal Code \u00a7 919(b)). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The grand jury may investigate or inquire into county matters of civil concern, such as the needs of county officers, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of the several offices. </p>\r\n<h4>Powers permitted to the grand jury include:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Free access, at reasonable times, to public prisons; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine all public records within the county;</li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine books and records of <ul>\r\n  <li>any incorporated city, or joint powers agency located in the county; </li>\r\n  <li>certain redevelopment agencies and housing authorities; </li>\r\n  <li>special-purpose assessing or taxing districts wholly or partly within the county; &amp; </li>\r\n  <li>non-profit corporations established by or operated on behalf of a public entity; </li></ul></li>\r\n  <li>The authority to investigate and report on operations and methods of performing duties of any such city, county, or joint powers agency and to make recommendations as deemed proper; </li>\r\n  <li>The ability, with permission of the Superior Court, to hire experts such as auditors and accountants; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to inquire into the sale, transfer and ownership of lands which might or should escheat to the state. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Note:\t</strong>The grand jury has no authority to investigate the courts or the acts or commissions of any judge or judicial employee.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Criminal Indictments</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Constitution permits criminal trial on the basis of indictment by a grand jury or by information after the district attorney recommends prosecution and a judge agrees that facts exist which warrant prosecution. In addition, under \u00a7 917 of the Penal Code, \"the grand jury may inquire into all public offenses committed or triable within the county, and present them to the court by indictment.\" In actual practice, grand juries seldom initiate such inquiries; rather, such offenses are generally brought to the grand jury by the district attorney, who asks for and generally receives an indictment, upon presentation of adequate facts.\r\n\r\n</p><p>According to the California Grand Jurors Association, the district attorney much more frequently bypasses the grand jury and uses the process known as a preliminary hearing. A 1954 survey of California district attorneys listed the following factors as influential in the decision to seek a grand jury indictment rather than using the preliminary hearing: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>High public interest in the case; </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that a preliminary hearing would take more time than a grand jury hearing; </li>\r\n  <li>The necessity for calling children or witnesses who would be subject to cross-examination at a preliminary hearing;</li>\r\n  <li>The existence of a weak or doubtful case which the district attorney wishes to test; </li>\r\n  <li>Cases involving malfeasance in office; and </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that witnesses are in a state prison. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A more recent study adds the following reasons for using the grand jury: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Cases where the defendant cannot be located and the time limit under the statute of limitations is about to expire, </li>\r\n  <li>Where the secrecy of the grand jury may allow defendants to be charged and taken into custody before they can pose potential danger to a witness's safety or flee from the jurisdiction, </li>\r\n  <li>The need to protect the identity of undercover agents, </li>\r\n  <li>And the ability to test a witness before a jury. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>From 1978 until 1990, grand juries were seldom used for indictments. A California Supreme Court ruling required holding preliminary hearings even if grand jury indictments were obtained. In 1990, a constitutional amendment made significant alterations in California criminal law and court procedures, including a provision that defendants were not entitled to preliminary hearings if indicted by a grand jury. As noted above, recent statutes (Penal Code \u00a7 904.6) give district attorneys the option of using special grand juries chosen from the regular jury pool to handle criminal cases and thus ensure indictment by those who represent a cross section of the community. Although the law allows criminal indictments to be brought by a grand jury, in practice, the District Attorney generally prefers to use the speedier preliminary hearing process.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">California Grand Juries</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> An Overview </h4>\r\n                      <p>Grand Juries are impaneled in every county in California. Article I, \u00a723 of the California Constitution states: \"a grand jury shall be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each county.\" Depending on a county's population, a specified number of citizens ranging from 11 to 23 in each of California's 58 counties are empowered to investigate and report on various activities of county and city government. The rules governing the makeup, organization, powers and duties of grand juries in California are found in the California Penal Code \u00a7888-939. Recent changes in the Penal Code (\u00a7904.6, 1991) permit any county to have an additional grand jury at the discretion of the presiding judge of the superior court. </p>\r\n                      <p>The statutes permit some variation in the manner and time of selection of jurors and require only that the term of service be for one year and coincide with the County's fiscal year. Qualifications for grand jurors are outlined in Penal Code \u00a7 893. This section requires the prospective grand juror be at least 18 years old, in possession of their natural faculties and have sufficient knowledge of the English language. In Sacramento County, each grand jury begins its term July 1 and ends its service June 30 of the following year. Throughout the State, prospective grand jurors in each county are chosen through a lengthy process that includes application, screening by the jury commissioner from Department of Motor Vehicle Records, voter rolls, and nomination of interested persons by Superior Court Judges. A thorough background check is made on all interested persons and list of qualified candidates is submitted to the judges for review and approval. Since some members of the existing grand jury may be carried over for a second term, the number of names drawn will equal those needed to provide a grand jury of 19 members. (The law allows for a grand jury of 23 in counties with greater than four million population and for 11 members in counties with less than 20,000 population. (Penal Code \u00a7888.2)) It has been the practice in many counties to advertise widely and to encourage many people to apply for the grand jury. Because grand jury service requires the devotion and commitment for only a token payment, it is desirable for grand jurors to have an interest in community affairs and be open-minded with a true concern for the views of others. Grand jurors also should posses some investigative skills and be able to take good notes and write and type reports. A good knowledge of the functions and responsibilities of city and county government is also helpful. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Investigation of Complaints and Accusations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury also is likely to receive a number of citizen complaints, many of which involve operations of county or city agencies or special districts. Whether the complaint is civil or criminal, rules of secrecy apply, and during the course of its investigation, the grand jury may not divulge the subject or methods of inquiry. The subject of the investigation and the methods of inquiry are only revealed when the final report is published. Privileged or confidential material is not included in the grand jury reports. Thus the names of those questioned and facts that might lead to the identity of a person who provided information to the grand jury are not released. \u00a7 919(c) of the Penal Code requires the grand jury to inquire into the willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Where misconduct is found, the grand jury may file an accusation leading to a trial. If the official is convicted, the person is thereby removed from office. Very few of these accusations are filed. Frequently, if there is misconduct in office, it is of a criminal nature, and an indictment rather than an accusation would be issued. It is also possible that an official would resign rather than face an accusation. The grand jury may file an accusatory pleading against a corporation doing business in its county of jurisdiction (Penal Code \u00a7 892). In a report published by the California Grand Jurors Association, misconduct in office could include any of the following: </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Nonfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The failure to act where duty requires an act; or</li>\r\n                        <li>Neglect or refusal, without sufficient cause or excuse, to do that which is the officer's legal duty to do, whether willfully or through malice; or </li>\r\n                        <li>Willful neglect of duty. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Misfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The improper or doing of an act that a person might lawfully do; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a duty or act that one ought to do or has a right to do, but in manner such as to infringe upon the rights of others. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Malfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The performance of an act that is positively unlawful or wrong; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a wrongful act that the person has no legal right to do. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Reports</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> State Law requires that each grand jury submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the presiding judge of the Superior Court. </p>\r\n                      <p>A report, just as an accusation or an indictment, must be approved by at least 12 of the 19 grand jurors (15 if it is a 23 member jury). With so many possible investigations and a term limited to a single year, it is necessary for each grand jury to make hard decisions as to what it wishes to undertake during the term. Except for mandated duties to report on the financial condition of the county and on the conditions of county jails, the grand jury discretion in determining its agenda. Most grand juries divide into committees for conducting investigations and for writing reports, but there seems to be a wide variation between counties as to the number and structure of committees; it is up to each grand jury to determine its own method of operation within the parameters of the law. </p>\r\n                      <p>Government agencies that are the subject of reports are required by law to respond to specific grand jury findings and recommendations. However, the grand jury has no enforcement power, and the agencies are under no legal obligation to carry out the recommendations. While some recommendations are ignored, others are followed; particularly those that suggest greater efficiency for operations and that do not require the expenditure of large sums of money. Grand jury criticisms of public officials and agencies frequently attract press attention, bringing greater community awareness of what is happening in public agencies. Many grand jurors believe that public officials tend to be more accountable when they know an impartial; outside body is looking over their collective shoulders. </p>\r\n                      <p>The California Grand Jurors Association (CGJA) (www.cgja.org), a statewide organization of former grand jurors has begun a program of identifying and indexing grand jury reports in each county with the hope of establishing a state archive of annual reports. The State Library also maintains an archive of grand jury reports from all counties. CGJA also monitors and occasionally proposes or endorses proposed laws to conserve and improve the grand jury as an important institution of local government. It offers services to those grand juries that may request advice and help in preparing informational manuals and in providing orientation for incoming jurors. Some members of the CGJA now provide orientation programs for those counties that request this service. </p>\r\n                      <p>While surrounded by secrecy before publication, grand jury reports become public documents when signed by the grand jury foreman and approved by the grand jury's advisory judge. Copies are sent: to all targeted government agencies, to interested officials, to public and private groups and individuals and to the press. At the end of the year, bound or loose-leaf copies of all reports are placed in all public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Online Grand Jury Reports</h4>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2018-2019%20Final%20Grand%20Jury%20Report.pdf\">2018 - 2019 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>                        \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2017-2018_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2017 - 2018 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2016-2017_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2016 - 2017 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2015-2016_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2015 - 2016 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2014-2015_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2014 - 2015 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2013-2014_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2013 - 2014 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2012-2013_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2012 - 2013 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2011-2012_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2011 - 2012 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2010-2011_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2010 - 2011 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2009-2010_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2009 - 2010 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2007-2008_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2007 - 2008 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2006-2007_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2006 - 2007 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2005-2006_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2005 - 2006 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2004-2005_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2004 - 2005 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2003-2004_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2003 - 2004 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2002-2003_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2002 - 2003 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Report-Revised_Response_02-23.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report-Revised</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2000-2001_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2000 - 2001 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Criminal/Civil Functions</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The major functions of a grand jury are divided into criminal indictments and civil investigations. While the same panel in Glenn County executes both functions, the civil investigation portion requires the majority of the jury\u2019s time. California Penal Code section 904.0(a) allows the presiding judge of Superior Court to impanel one additional grand jury. The additional grand jury would have sole jurisdiction to return criminal indictments.</p>\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Indictments </h4>\r\n                      <p>The District Attorney will bring the majority of cases that are presented to the grand jury; however, the State Attorney General or a Special Prosecutor may present a case. The responsibility of the grand jury does not extend beyond the determination of whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has committed such crime.\r\n                        \r\n                        Criminal indictment hearings are conducted in secrecy to protect witnesses and defendants in cases of no indictment. During a criminal investigation only District Attorney representatives and a court reporter are allowed in the jury room, with a few exceptions. No person other than a grand juror may be present during deliberations or voting. An indictment can be returned only if a minimum of 12 jurors agrees. </p>\r\n                      <p>Historically, the grand jury indictment process is used for cases where: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Public officials, employees, or police officers are involved </li>\r\n                        <li>Statute of limitations is a concern</li>\r\n                        <li>The indictment is complex and must be presented over a long period of time </li>\r\n                        <li>Grand jury subpoena powers are necessary </li>\r\n                        <li>Secrecy and non-adversary nature for sensitive cases are needed, such as cases involving children or rape victims </li>\r\n                        <li>Criminal indictments are extremely rare in Glenn County. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The civil, or \u201cwatchdog\u201d, responsibilities of the grand jury encompass the examination of all aspects of county government, including special districts, to ensure that the county is being governed honestly and efficiently and that county monies are being handled appropriately. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury is mandated by law to inquire into the conditions and management of public jails.\r\n                        \r\n                        The grand jury may conduct investigations on public agencies and on the administration and affairs of any city within the county, as well as examine books and records of redevelopment agencies. It is also appropriate for any private citizen, county official or county employee to present a written complaint to the grand jury for investigation. </p>\r\n                      <p>During its term, the grand jury selects the government affairs it wishes to investigate. These investigations are generally conducted by committees, which correspond with the primary functions of the county. Committees may ask for support and advice from the Superior Court Presiding Judge, District Attorney, County Counsel, Attorney General, or outside consultants. </p>\r\n                      <p>On the last day of each year of service, the grand jury is required by law to submit all final reports to the Presiding Judge. These reports include all studies and investigations conducted by the grand jury during its term, with appropriate recommendations. Copies of individual reports are submitted to each county entity investigated, with instructions that response to findings/recommendations be made by the responsible governing body within 60 or 90 days. </p>\r\n                      <p>Past grand jury reports are available for inspection by the public at most public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Complaint Form</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <p>\r\nDownload a <a href=\"documents/Grand_Jury_Complaint_Form.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Jury complaint form</a>. </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Qualifications</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The law states grand jury applicants must have these qualifications: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Citizen of the United States, 18 years of age or older</li>\r\n                        <li>Resident of state and county for at least one year prior to being selected </li>\r\n                        <li>In possession of natural faculties, ordinary intelligence, sound judgment, fair character </li>\r\n                        <li>Possess sufficient knowledge of the English language </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Applicants are disqualified if any of the following apply: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as a trial juror in any court in the state</li>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as an elected public official </li>\r\n                        <li>Discharged as a grand juror in any court in the state within one year </li>\r\n                        <li>Convicted of malfeasance in office or any felony or other high crime </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Beyond the legal requirements, several other qualifications are desirable for a grand juror:</p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>General knowledge of the functions, authorities, and responsibilities of county and city government and of other civil entities </li>\r\n                        <li>Research abilities, including ability to read and comprehend complex material, a background in accessing/analyzing facts and experience in report writing </li>\r\n                        <li>Background in group/committee work </li>\r\n                        <li>Good to excellent health </li>\r\n                        <li>Respect and objectivity concerning the positions and views of others </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n<!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Grand Jury"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/grand-jury.shtml"},
{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n        \r\n      \t\t<p>The information contained in this page does not apply to appeals from a small claims traffic judgment.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In cases other than death penalty appeals, small claims or traffic, the party seeks appellate review in the court of appeal. After the court of appeal has made its decision, the party may seek review in the California Supreme Court. Death penalty appeals are decided only by the Supreme Court. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Thousands of cases are appealed in California every year. They include criminal convictions; civil cases involving personal injury, contract, employment, real estate, probate, dissolution of marriage, child custody and many other issues; and administrative matters, such as worker's compensation. In the vast majority of these cases, the decision of the court of appeal is final. The Supreme Court grants review of only a few Court of Appeal decisions when necessary to resolve novel or disputed questions of law. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>Proceedings in appellate courts are very different from those in trial courts. In trial courts, a judge or jury hears the testimony of witnesses, reviews physical evidence, exhibits and documents, and applies the law and reaches a decision. Appellate courts, on the other hand, do not decide an appeal by taking new evidence or reassessing the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the trial court. Rather, they review the written record to determine if the trial court properly interpreted the law and used the correct procedures when considering the case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>To ensure cases are examined from several perspectives, each Supreme Court case is heard by all seven of the high court's justices, while each court of appeal case is considered by a panel of three justices. Supreme and appellate court justices are assisted in their review by the parties' written and oral arguments. To decide a case in either court, a majority of the justices must agree. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All justices are bound to apply the law whether or not they personally agree with it. Justices may not substitute their own ideas for what the law should be, but are bound by the federal and state constitutions, statutes, and other rules and regulations legislated by those with the authority to do so, including the state legislature and voters by initiative. Judges must enforce all laws without being swayed by public opinion. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges to \"be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism ...\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, and is designed specifically to foster judges' independence from improper external pressures. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The California Constitution generally requires appellate courts to decide a case in a written opinion setting forth the facts and rules of law upon which the decision is made. By constitutional mandate, the decision must be issued within 90 days after the case has been taken under submission or the justices hearing the case cannot receive their pay. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Important appellate opinions are published in law books and by electronic means, which are available to judges, lawyers, the public, and the news media. Such opinions become rules of law, which govern future disputes. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In 1996-1997, 18,802 criminal, juvenile, and civil cases were noticed for appeal. During the same period, appellate courts affirmed 95 percent of the criminal and juvenile cases, and 76 percent of the civil cases they heard. Whenever an appellate court reverses, it almost always allows the trial court to rehear the case using the correct law and procedures. Before you file an appeal, you should read this information carefully. You are responsible for preparing all documents and doing any legal research you feel is necessary. The clerk cannot advise you on any legal issues or advise you as to the content of any papers required. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>When you appeal, you are asking the appellate court to review a decision of the trial judge because you disagree with it. The court cannot review questions of fact. It can only decide if there was an error of law that was serious enough to have prevented you from having a fair trial. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The appellate court cannot retry the case. No witnesses can be heard, and the court cannot consider any evidence that was not presented at trial. It cannot consider conflicting evidence or choose to believe you instead of the other witnesses. The trial judge's determinations of credibility and conflicts in the evidence are binding in the appellate court. The appellate court can only look at the record on appeal and decide whether the trial judge's decision in the case is supported by substantial evidence. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The things you must do to be sure your appeal will be heard are in the California Rules of Court, California Rules 101 through 108 apply to all appeals. Rules 121 through 144 apply to civil appeals, and Rules 182 through 191apply to appeals of traffic infractions and criminal cases. If you do not follow the rules carefully, you may lose the chance to have your appeal considered. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All papers filed with the court must be served on the opposing party or that party's lawyer and must have a valid proof of service attached. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>The most important act in an appeal is filing the written notice of appeal. This notice must be filed with the Appeals unit before the deadline. There are many time limits and regulations in proceeding with an appeal. Please read the California Rules of Court to verify that you meet the time limits for every step. Failure to meet some time limits may result in dismissal of your appeal. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Note: If you do not file the notice of appeal on time, the appellate court cannot consider your case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Appeals"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/appeals.shtml"},

The judge will also tell you what the lawsuit is about. </p>\r\n                      <p>Next, the judge and the attorneys will question each of the people in the jury box to find out if you can be fair and impartial in this particular case. </p>\r\n                      <p>One of the attorneys may \u201cchallenge you for cause.\u201d This means the attorney will ask the judge to excuse you from the jury for a specific legal reason. </p>\r\n                      <p>Each lawyer has an unlimited number of challenges for cause.\r\n                        \r\n                        Each attorney has the right to a certain number of peremptory challenges. That is, the attorney may ask that you be excused without giving any reason at all. If this happens, don\u2019t take it personally; the lawyer is merely exercising a right given by law. </p>\r\n                      <p>After the required number of jurors has been chosen, the jury panel is sworn to try the case. </p>\r\n                      <p>The attorneys will make an opening statement to the jurors and then the presentation of evidence will be given. After all the evidence is given, the attorneys will make a closing statement. The judge will then instruct the jurors regarding their duties as a juror.</p>\r\n                      <p>In the jury deliberation room, one person will be selected as the foreperson. He or she will lead the discussion and encourage everyone to join in. <strong>Don\u2019t be afraid to speak up during these deliberations. </strong>The whole idea of a jury is to come to a decision after full and frank discussion based on calm, unbiased reasoning. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">The Verdict</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n   \r\n                      <p>In your efforts to reach a verdict, keep in mind that you should consider only the evidence that was presented in the courtroom. You should not guess or speculate about things not discussed in court, but you can draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence presented.</p>\r\n                      <p>It is important to take the case you are deciding seriously. After all, if you were a party in the case, it would be important to you, and you would want the jury to give it serious consideration even if the controversy appears less significant to others. </p>\r\n                      <p>All jurors should deliberate and vote on each issue to be decided in the case. When it is time to count votes, it is the foreperson's duty to see that this is done properly. In a civil case, the judge will tell you how many jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict. In a criminal case, the unanimous agreement of all 12 jurors is required. If the required number of jurors agree on each issue to be decided, the foreperson will sign and date the verdict, advise the bailiff or court attendant, and return with the signed verdict and any unsigned verdict forms from prior votes to the courtroom. </p>\r\n                      <p>If a jury cannot arrive at a verdict within a reasonable time and indicates to the judge that there is no possibility that they can reach a verdict, the judge, in his or her discretion, may dismiss the jury. This situation is a mistrial, sometimes referred to as a \"hung jury,\" and may mean the case goes to trial again with a new jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>When you have reached a verdict the foreperson will record your verdict on an official form. The bailiff will tell the judge you are ready and you will return to the jury box. The judge will ask if you reached a verdict. The foreperson will answer, handing the written verdict to the bailiff who in turn will hand it to the judge. The clerk will read the verdict aloud. Sometimes one of the parties will ask that the jury be polled. This means that the clerk will ask each juror if this is his or her own verdict. The jury service will then be complete. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Three Main Steps of a Jury Trial</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> California juries have been providing outstanding service and have set a high standard. The state of California and your trial judge thank you and all jurors for giving generously of your time and for taking jury duty seriously.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 1: Selection of a Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>When a jury trial is about to begin, the trial court judge requests a panel of prospective jurors to be sent to the courtroom from the jury assembly room so that the jury selection process can begin. After reporting to a courtroom, the prospective jurors are first required to swear that they will truthfully answer all questions asked about their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>The perjury admonishment, which basically requires potential jurors to tell the truth when answering the questions, is read as follows: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will accurately and truthfully answer, under penalty of perjury, all questions propounded to you concerning your qualifications and competency to serve as a trial juror in the matter pending before this court, and that failure to do so may subject you to criminal prosecution? </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>The court clerk calls 12 or more jurors to take seats in the jury box. The judge speaks to the jurors, telling them the names of the people involved in the case and their attorneys and stating what the case is about. The judge and the attorneys ask jurors questions to determine if the jurors are free of bias (prejudice) or whether there is any reason why any of them cannot be fair and impartial; this process is called voir dire. It is important to ask questions if you do not understand a question. Also, each juror is obligated to follow the law as explained by the judge; if you cannot follow the law, you need to let the judge know.</p>\r\n                      <p>The law lets the judge and the lawyers excuse individual jurors from service in a particular case for various reasons. If a lawyer wants to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" to excuse the juror. Challenges can be for cause or peremptory. There are two types of juror challenges: a challenge for cause and a peremptory challenge. The process of questioning and excusing jurors continues until 12 persons are accepted as jurors for the trial. Alternate jurors may also be selected. The judge and attorneys agree that these jurors are qualified to decide impartially and intelligently the factual issues in the case. When the selection of the jury is completed, the jurors take the following oath: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court, and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court?\" </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>As a juror you should think seriously about the oath before taking it. The oath means you give your word to reach your verdict upon only the evidence presented in the trial and the court's instructions about the law. You cannot consider any other evidence or instruction other than those given by the court in the case before you. Remember that your role as a juror is as important as the judge's in making sure that justice is done. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 2: The Trial </h2>\r\n                      <h3>Jurors' duties during the trial: </h3>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not </strong>talk to others about the case. This responsibility requires that you not talk at all with the lawyers, witnesses, or anyone else connected with the case. The lawyers understand this rule. You will find that, even at the risk of seeming rude or unfriendly, the lawyers must avoid even casual conversation with you. In order to prevent even the appearance of improper conversation, a wise policy for you to follow is to avoid any contact with the lawyers or the parties. You also cannot talk to anybody about the case. There are important reasons for this: all cases must be decided only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you were to discuss the facts of the case or your impressions of it with your family, friends, or with any other person, you might hear their ideas and might be influenced by people who do not know all the facts. If you believe that someone has tried to speak to you about the case, you must report what happened to the judge by contacting the bailiff immediately. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> make up your mind before hearing all the evidence. It is also your duty not to form or express an opinion about the case to anyone. This means that you keep an open mind until you have heard the evidence from all sides and the case is given to the jury for deliberation. Only then may you discuss it with your fellow jurors and even then only when all jurors are present. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> conduct your own investigation of the case. It would also be a violation of your duty as a juror to conduct any investigation of the case. As a juror you must not become an amateur detective. For example, you must not visit the scene of an accident, an alleged crime, or any event or transaction involved in the case. You should not conduct experiments or consult any other person or reference works for additional information. If the judge feels that an inspection of a place is necessary or will be helpful, he or she will arrange and supervise an inspection by the whole jury. If you have a question about the evidence, let the judge know by handing a note to the bailiff and he or she will make a decision about your question. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Attorneys' opening statements</strong>: As the trial begins, the lawyer for the plaintiff in a civil case or the prosecutor in a criminal case may make an opening statement telling you what they expect the evidence to show. The defendant's lawyer may also choose to give an opening statement after the plaintiff's attorney or prosecutor, telling you what the defense expects the evidence to show. The lawyers' statements are not evidence. Their purpose is to give you the framework of the case, the points of conflict, and the issues of the case that you will need to decide. Be careful that you do not let any of the information presented in the opening statements become evidence in your mind. Remember that the lawyers' statements are only their versions of what happened, not evidence. </p>\r\n                      <p> <strong>Presentation of evidence</strong>: Evidence may be presented by the attorneys in the form of a written document or an object (a gun, another weapon, a photograph, an x-ray, or some other physical thing). These are called exhibits. Evidence may also include the testimony of witnesses under oath in the courtroom.\r\n                        \r\n                        Attorneys' closing statements: After all the evidence has been reviewed in court, lawyers for each side may present their final summary of the case, sometimes referred to as an argument. The lawyers can talk about reasons and make conclusions, but these are not evidence; they are efforts to persuade you. You should listen to these statements carefully and consider them thoughtfully, but you must form your own opinion about the outcome of the case based upon all evidence presented. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Judge's Instructions on the Law</strong>: Either before or after the closing arguments by the lawyers, the judge will explain the law that applies to the case to you. This is the judge's instruction to the jury. You have to apply that law to the facts, as you have heard them, in arriving at your verdict. You must consider all of the instructions and give them equal consideration. Keep in mind that you must follow the law as the judge states it to you. If the judge gives you an instruction that seems different from what you read here or another instruction given at another trial, you must accept the instruction given by the judge of the case you are deciding as correct and be guided by the judge's statement only. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>When considering the evidence</strong>, an important difference exists between civil and criminal cases in the degree of proof required to sustain an accusation. In a criminal case, the defendant, in order to be convicted, must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, a party suing another has to prove that charge by a preponderance of the evidence. In every trial, the judge carefully explains the degree of proof required to reach a verdict. You should pay careful attention to the instructions on the degree of proof. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 3: Deliberations by the Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>After closing statements by the attorneys and the judge's instructions on the law, the bailiff or court attendant will take you to the jury room for deliberations. Your first duty when entering the jury room is to select a foreperson. The jury should carefully select a well-qualified foreperson. The foreperson's duty is to see that discussion happens in a free and orderly manner, that the issues you must decide are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given an opportunity to participate. </p>\r\n                      <p>After you enter the jury room for deliberations, the exhibits that you are to consider are given to you. If you are not given written instruction from the judge on the law, you may request them. If you feel you need further instructions or to have certain testimony read back to you, inform the judge through the bailiff or the court attendant. Since these purposes can be accomplished only by returning everyone (including parties and lawyers) to the courtroom, you should not make these requests lightly. The procedure usually takes time, but this delay is understandable if you seriously believe doing so is necessary or helpful to you in reaching a verdict. There is a booklet, \"Behind Closed Doors\" that can assist jurors with the format of their deliberation. It is published by the American Judicature Society, which can be contacted at <a href=\"http://www.ajs.org\">http://www.ajs.org</a>. </p>\r\n                      <p>Quite often in the jury room the jurors may argue and have a difference of opinion. When this occurs, each juror should try to express his or her opinion and the reasoning supporting it. It would be wrong for a juror to refuse to listen to the arguments and opinions of the others or to deny another juror the right to express an opinion. Remember that jurors are not advocates, but impartial judges of the facts. By carefully considering each juror's opinion and the reasons behind it, it is usually possible for the jurors to reach a verdict. A juror should not hesitate to change his or her mind when there is a good reason. But each juror should maintain his or her position unless conscientiously persuaded to change that opinion by the other jurors. Following a full and free discussion with fellow jurors, each juror should vote only according to his or her own honest convictions. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">General Information</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li> <strong>Restrooms</strong> are located in the hallway in the Orland Branch and on the second floor of the courthouse in Willows. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Public Telephones</strong> are located in the hallway at the Orland Branch and across the street in Memorial Hall in Willows.</li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Children, relatives or friends</strong> are not permitted. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror Eligibility:</strong> All U.S. citizens who are over the age of 18, a resident of the county that issued the jury summons, and are able to understand the English language are eligible to serve on a jury in the State of California. Of these people, only convicted felons, meaning anyone who has been found guilty of a serious crime, cannot serve. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror summons</strong>: Once you have received a jury summons, read the instructions carefully. If you have any questions, contact the jury office. Be sure to bring your summons with you when your report to court. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Term of Service</strong>: Jury service is a \"one day or one trial\" term of service. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you will serve for the duration of that one trial. Average length of a trial is two (2) to five (5) days, although trials can run longer. If you are not selected for a trial during your service day, your service obligation shall be complete for one year. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Compensation</strong>: California allows payment of $15 a day plus mileage, at the current rate according to federal standards, per mile one way for jury service. For reimbursement, ask your local jury office or the bailiff in the courtroom for more specific information for your local court. Although this is only a fraction of the cost of each juror's time, the courts are working with the Legislature and the Governor to increase juror fees. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There is ample parking at both courthouse locations. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Security</strong>: People entering the courthouse may be searched. Purses, briefcases, or other containers may also be searched. Weapons are prohibited in the courthouse facility. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Postponements</strong>: By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Orientation</strong>: You will be instructed regarding your jury service when you first appear. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Job and School</strong>: Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. This is the law. Section 230 of the California Labor Code is intended to prevent any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service and who has given reasonable notice of when the employee is to serve. Notice is generally considered reasonable if it is given as soon as possible once the employee has been summoned. The California Education Code (\u00a7\u00a7 44037 and 8 7036) and Rule of Court 5.5(d)(7) protect teachers, other school employees, and students as well. If you are harassed or fired, contact your local jury office or the judge assigned to your trial. If your employer has harassed you because of your service on a jury, contact the Department of Industrial Relation's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. You must complete a complaint form and turn it in to the Labor Board within six months from when the harassment happened. Remember to keep any certificate issued by the court clerk to prove that you served and for your employer's records. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Excuses for Undue Hardship</strong>: In certain serious cases, the jury commissioner or the judge may excuse you for up to one year. These are called undue hardship cases. If you have a personal situation that stops you from being able to serve, write that reason on your summons and mail it back or call the jury office. When listing reasons such as medical, job, or dependent care issues, be prepared to provide documentation to receive a postponement and not an excuse. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Disqualification</strong>: A person is disqualified or temporarily excused if he or she is a felon, nonresident, non-citizen, under a conservatorship, or in some cases, a peace officer. If you fall into one of these categories, contact the jury office to explain your situation. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Although we attempt to make jury service as convenient and efficient as possible, jurors should be advised that there will be times you will spend waiting. You may wish to bring something to occupy your time. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n              <!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Trial Jury"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/trial-jury.shtml"},

There are three levels of severity of traffic violations: infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. Most traffic violations are infractions, but some, like vehicular manslaughter, are felonies. </p>\r\n          <p>Infractions are not punishable by jail or prison and are not subject to trial by jury; the punishment is a fine. Penalties for infractions can be as much as $200 or more for common traffic infractions including speeding, running a red light or stop sign.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Misdemeanors, such as driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, can carry penalties of as much as $2,000 or more and/or confinement in a city or county jail. The maximum penalty allowed in California for a misdemeanor is one year in county jail and/or a fine.\r\n            Felonies are punishable by formal probation or formal confinement in state prison. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infractions </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common infractions are moving violations without injury, such as speeding and running a red light. Drivers stopped for moving violations are usually released after they sign a Notice to Appear, printed on the ticket, agreeing to appear at a set date and time. The traffic ticket provides information about when to appear in court. Drivers charged with an infraction that want to admit guilt can avoid a court appearance by paying the fine in person or by mail. If drivers do not appear or pay the traffic fine within the authorized time, their driver?s license may be suspended. Usually they will not be able to renew their vehicle registration until they have paid all outstanding parking tickets and administrative costs in full. Drivers who plead not guilty and request a trial may be required to post bail or sign a written document to appear in court. If they fail to appear, they may be charged with the additional misdemeanor of violating their agreement to appear. In this case, a warrant may be issued for their arrest and their driving privilege may also be suspended. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Misdemeanors </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common misdemeanors are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and driving without a valid license. In some cases, drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be taken into custody. Drivers charged with almost all other traffic misdemeanors and infractions usually will not be taken into custody but will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear in court. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infraction Trials </h2>\r\n          <p>If a driver has been charged with a traffic violation they do not have the right to trial by a jury. The defendant may offer opposing evidence, argue the law, present supporting witnesses and other evidence, and cross-examine the law enforcement officer who issued the citation. </p>\r\n          <p>If a driver is judged \"not guilty,\" the bail will be refunded if previously posted. Drivers judged \"guilty\" must pay the fine or, in a serious misdemeanor, serve the sentence. People who willfully do not pay the fine and/or do not serve the sentence within the time authorized may be charged with contempt of court or failure to pay a fine, in which case court collections unit will begin to pursue the court-ordered debt from the individual. </p>\r\n          <h2>Driving Under the Influence </h2>\r\n          <p>The penalties for driving under the influence vary depending on the number of a driver's prior convictions for this offense.</p>\r\n          <p>A first-time violation can be punished by a jail term of not more than six months, a fine and penalty ranging from $1,000 to $2,700, and suspension or restriction of driving privileges for six months. Drivers with three DUI convictions within seven years normally receive jail terms of not less than 120 days nor more than one-year and a fine and penalty of not less than $1,053, and no more than $2,700. The person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be revoked for three years. </p>\r\n          <p>Drivers charged with a DUI must appear in court for an arraignment and may be requested to post bail. Bail can vary from $300 to $15,000. Whenever the possible sentences include jail time, the court, upon request, will appoint an attorney for drivers who cannot afford to hire one. </p>\r\n          <h2>How Parking Violations Are Settled </h2>\r\n          <p>Since July 1, 1993, legislation transferred the adjudication (settling) of parking tickets from the courts to the issuing agencies.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Only cases that are appealed because they cannot be settled after hearings with the issuing agency will come to the court.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <h2>Mandatory Automobile Insurance Law </h2>\r\n          <p>Under the mandatory insurance law, all drivers must carry evidence of financial responsibility and must provide that evidence to an officer on request. A driver who fails to provide proof of insurance on request by an officer during a traffic stop is guilty of an infraction.</p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant claims an inability to pay both the insurance and the fine or other financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to make installment payments or to pay the entire amount within a specified time. If you request installment payments, an additional $35.00 will be charged to your account.The court may reduce or waive the fine based on a defendant's inability to pay, but the Legislature specifically declared that it is in the interest of justice that the minimum fines for violations be enforced. In a case of extreme financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to substitute community service in place of payment of the fine. </p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant fails to pay the fine (or complete community service), the court may issue a warrant for the separate offense of failure to pay or obey a court order, may assess civil assessments, may impose additional fines, and may suspend the defendant's driving privileges. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Tickets </h2>\r\n          <p>If you are charged with a traffic misdemeanor or infraction, you usually will not be taken into custody. Instead, you will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear, often called a \"citation\" or a \"ticket.\" You may be taken into custody if you refuse to sign the citation; the arresting law enforcement officer also signs it. Your signature does not mean that you are admitting guilt. It only means that you promise to appear in court at a date and time specified either on the front of the Notice to Appear or in the courtesy notice that may be mailed by the court to the address on the citation. The court appearance will usually be a minimum of 21 days after the ticket is issued. </p>\r\n          <p>General traffic information please call the Clerk\u2019s Office at <a href=\"tel:530-934-6446\">530-934-6446</a>. </p>\r\n          <p>Payments on delinquent traffic ticket fines contact the collection agency. </p>\r\n          <h2>California Rules of Court, Rules 4.106 and 4.335 </h2>\r\n          <p>You have the right to petition the Court to reduce or vacate the civil assessment or for a judicial officer to determine if you have the ability to pay your fine. </p>\r\n          <h2>Reduce or Vacate Civil Assessment</h2>\r\n          <p>You must ask the Court, in writing, for a review of your circumstances. You have the option to ask the Court to make a determination based on your declaration and supporting documents or request to appear before a judicial officer to be heard. The judicial officer will make the determination of whether or not there is good cause to reduce or vacate the civil assessment.\u00a0 </p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The petition can be obtained from the clerk's office or you can <a href=\"documents/Civil%20assessment%20Petition%20and%20Order-Ability%20to%20Pay%20Determination%20form.pdf\">download the petition form</a>.</p>\r\n          <h2>Ability-to-Pay Determination </h2>\r\n          <p>You may ask the Court for an ability-to-pay determination at sentencing or while the judgement remains unpaid. Your petition will be reviewed by a judicial officer to determine your ability to pay your fine. The court may: </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Allow you to make installment payments; </li>\r\n            <li>Allow you to complete community service to satisfy your fine;\r\n              \u2013 Suspend the fine, in part or in whole; </li>\r\n            <li>Set the matter for a hearing; or </li>\r\n            <li>Deny the petition. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n\t\t\t<h3>California Court Forms</h3>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr320.pdf\">TR 320</a></li>\r\n            <li> <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr321.pdf\">TR 321</a></li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>A petition to reduce or vacate the civil assessment does not stay any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments unless specifically ordered by the court. </p>\r\n          \r\n          <p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n          \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Traffic Court"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/traffic.shtml"},
{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <p>The rules are fairly simple and the hearing is informal. </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>The party filing the claim is the plaintiff. </li>\r\n            <li>The person being sued is the defendant. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>If you are the defendant and are filing a Claim of Defendant, you will remain the defendant and the plaintiff will remain the plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p> If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no right of appeal. So if you should lose, that's probably the end of the case. However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again. </p>\r\n          <p>If you are the plaintiff and a Claim of Defendant is filed (the defendant sues you on the same case) and you have a judgment against you, you may file an appeal on that decision. </p>\r\n          <h2>Small Claims Advisor </h2>\r\n          <p>The Self-Help Center has all of the small claim forms and is able to assist you with filling out the forms. </p>\r\n          <h2>Filing Your Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>Go to the court closest to you and obtain a small claims packet for filing your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Monetary Limits </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court has a monetary limit, called a jurisdictional limit, on the amount of money damages that a person can claim. The most you can ask for is $5,000; however, you are limited to filing no more than two claims anywhere in the State of California for over $2,500 in one calendar year. You may file an unlimited amount of claims for $2,500 or less. </p>\r\n          <h2>Role of the Court Clerk </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court clerks can answer many kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited by law to give legal advice. The Small Claims Advisory Clinic provides legal advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant. See the other helpful web sites listed below for information on filing a claim. </p>\r\n          <h2> Web Site to Help You File a Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>The California Courts\u2019 web site [http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm] has a section full of information needed to go through the process of a small claims suit, including an overview, forms, rules, tips, and much more. </p>\r\n          <h2>What to Expect in Court </h2>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Come to court organized and prepared.</li>\r\n            <li>Arrive promptly at your assigned court time; if you arrive late, your case may be heard without you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring enough photocopies of all your evidence for each party and the judge. </li>\r\n            <li>Any copies submitted to the judge the day of trial may not be returned to you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring all your witnesses. </li>\r\n            <li>If both parties are present, meaning both the plaintiff and the defendant, you will be asked to go into the hallway to exchange and review any documents that will be submitted to the judge as evidence. This must be done prior to the case being heard. </li>\r\n            <li>Have all your documents ready and in chronological order when your case is called. </li>\r\n            <li>There will be several other cases assigned to the same time as yours so you may have to wait to have your case heard. </li>\r\n            <li>You may be asked to sign a stipulation allowing a pro-tem judge (temporary judge) to hear your case. If you do not wish to have a temporary judge hear your case, your case may be continued to a date when there is a commissioner or judge of the Superior Court to hear your case. </li>\r\n            <li>You may decline a temporary judge when you file your claim and avoid a continuance to another date. </li>\r\n            <li>When your case is called, you will stand at a podium in front of the superior court judge or a pro-tem judge. You will be asked to present your evidence and give your testimony. Always address the judge and not the other party.\r\n              Usually, the plaintiff will give his/her testimony first and then the defendant.</li>\r\n            <li>The judge will probably ask questions to further his/her understanding of the case. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are the only party to appear at the trial and you are the plaintiff, you still must prove your case. Do not expect to \"automatically\" win your case if the other party does not appear. </li>\r\n            <li>The proceedings will not be recorded by a court reporter or by any other type of recording. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are not fluent in the English language, you must bring an interpreter with you. Small Claims courts do not provide interpreters. </li>\r\n            <li> The judge will usually not tell you the decision in court. The decision (judgment) will be mailed to you. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h2>If You Are The Defendant</h2>\r\n          <p>If you have been named as a defendant in a Small Claims action and have received an order to appear at a Small Claims hearing, this means that you are being sued. If you don't know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately for an explanation. </p>\r\n          <p>Never ignore an order to appear in court even if you think the case is wrong, unfair, or has no basis. If you do not appear in court at the proper time and date, the court may still hear and decide the case without you and you may lose the suit by default. </p>\r\n          <p>If you believe the plaintiff has caused you injury or owes you money for any reason, you can file a claim against the plaintiff in the same Small Claims court action. If your case is related to the subject of the plaintiff's case, it may be helpful and convenient to resolve it at the same hearing by filing a Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p>If judgment has been entered against you and the appeal time has lapsed, your money or property and maybe a portion of your earnings can then be taken legally by the judgment creditor to pay the judgment against you. A Small Claims judgment is public record. Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, these agencies come to the court often and place the judgment on the losing party's credit record even after the judgment is paid.</p>\r\n          <p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n   \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Small Claims"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/small-claims.shtml"},

You may also choose to see the mediator alone and at a different time from the other parent. </p>\r\n          <p>Also, if a mediator suspects any kind of child abuse, he or she is required by law to report it.

An unlawful detainer proceeding is an accelerated method for recovery of possession of leased premises. It is a limited proceeding designed to permit a landlord to recover possession of real property from a tenant who is wrongfully in possession. (Because of its summary character, an unlawful detainer action is not a suitable vehicle for trying complicated ownership issues involving allegations of fraud.) </p>\r\n          <p> Like civil actions generally, unlawful detainer actions are initiated by the filing of a complaint, issuance of a summons, and service of the complaint and summons on the defendant.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Landlords in California must first follow all requirements for eviction proceedings prescribed in California statutes and follow any applicable local ordinances. </p>\r\n          <h3>Three-day and 30-day notice</h3>\r\n          <p>An unlawful detainer proceeding is usually initiated by the landlord's serving a 3-day or 30-day notice on the tenant. A landlord must strictly comply with the statutory requirements for service of the notice to quit the leased premises. \r\n            \r\n            Among 3-day notices are notices to quit (\"leave\"), notices to perform covenant or quit, and notices to pay rent or quit. Three-day notices to quit are used when a tenant has allegedly breached (\"broken\") a covenant (\"agreement\") in the lease that cannot be cured. A 3-day notice to perform covenant or quit is used when there has been a curable breach other than nonpayment of rent, for example, breach of a covenant not to assign or sublet the premises. The most common notice is a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. </p>\r\n          <p>A landlord\u2019s choice to declare a forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement on a 3-day notice is nullified and the lease or rental agreement remains in effect if the tenant performs within 3 days after service of the notice or if the landlord waives the breach after service of the notice. </p>\r\n          <p>A 30-day notice to quit usually addresses a situation in which the landlord wishes to terminate an indefinite-term tenancy (that is, a holdover tenant or a tenant on a month-to-month tenancy). The landlord and tenant may provide by agreement at the time the tenancy is created that either party may terminate the tenancy on less than 30 days\u2019 notice, but the agreement may not provide for less than 7 days\u2019 notice. </p>\r\n          <p>No notice is required for an unlawful detainer action based on the expiration of a fixed-term tenancy, nor is notice required when a tenant occupies the property as part of his or her employment (for example, as an apartment manager), which has been terminated. </p>\r\n          <h3>Filing a complaint</h3>\r\n          <p>After you have complied with applicable notice requirements, the residential eviction process is begun by filing a complaint with the local court. To file a complaint, you may use Complaint Unlawful Detainer (Form 982.1(90)) and file the form with the local court, paying the applicable filing fee. </p>\r\n          <h3>Obtaining and serving the summons</h3>\r\n          <p>You then obtain a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) from the local court and must serve the summons on the tenant, adhering to appropriate service requirements. </p>\r\n          <h2>Tenant Requirements </h2>\r\n          <p>Responding to the complaint. As a tenant, if you are served with a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) and complaint concerning an eviction, you must respond to the summons. You may use Judicial Council Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer, to respond and must file the answer form with the local court that issued the summons. You must also pay a filing fee when filing the answer form, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. </p>\r\n          <p>Download fee waiver forms and instructions by clicking on the form number below:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a17.pdf\">982(a)(17)</a> Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a18.pdf\">982(a)(18)</a> Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>The following forms are used for later filings in your case: </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a20.pdf\">982(a)(20)</a> Application for Waiver of Additional Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a181.pdf\">982(a)(18.1)</a> Court Fees and Costs Order on Application for Waiver of Additional </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are confidential forms for the court. Do not have them served on the other party.</p>\r\n          <p>If there is more than one tenant, or defendant, listed in the complaint, each tenant must respond separately or a default judgment may be entered against the tenants who do not file an answer. Two tenants can share one answer form, but each must sign the answer form individually and pay a separate filing fee. If you are filing the answer for yourself only, put your name on line 1 of the answer form. If you are filing the answer for yourself and another tenant named in the complaint, put both your names on line 1. </p>\r\n          <p>Each tenant named in the complaint has five days after the summons is served to file an answer form at the court that issued the summons. (The five-day response time includes Saturdays and Sundays, but excludes all judicial holidays. If the last day for filing a response is a Saturday or Sunday, the tenant has until close of business on the next court day to file a response.) </p>\r\n          <p>A letter or phone call does not serve as a response. The answer must be on the proper legal form \u2014 Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer \u2014 in order for the court to hear the case.</p>\r\n          <p>If an answer is not filed on time, the tenant may lose the case, be evicted, and have his or her wages, money, and property taken by the landlord without further warning from the court. </p>\r\n          <p>The tenant\u2019s time to respond to a complaint for unlawful detainer is not affected by the tenant's quitting of the leased premises.</p>\r\n          <p>Serving the answer and completing a proof of service form: Before you file your answer with the court, you first have to make sure that a copy of the answer is served on the landlord of the property. This means that a copy of the answer along with a proof of service form must be given to the attorney for the landlord or, if the landlord is not represented by an attorney, to the landlord. It can be served by mail or hand delivered, but only by a person who is at least 18 years of age and is not a plaintiff or defendant in the case. </p>\r\n          <p> A Proof of Service form is used to show the court that a copy of your answer was sent to the other party in the case before you filed the original answer. It does not have to be received by the other party before you file; it must only be put in the mail. The Proof of Service must be signed by a person over 18 who is not a party to the case. This means that neither you, nor any other tenant in the case, can sign the Proof of Service form. You can obtain a Proof of Service form from your local superior court or from books containing general legal forms available from legal publishers or bookstores. </p>\r\n          <p> The court will not accept an answer for filing without a signed Proof of Service form attached. </p>\r\n          <p>You may want to call an attorney for assistance. If you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Landlord / Tenant / Unlawful Detainer"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/landlord-tenant.shtml"},

It handles two types of cases: </p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Delinquency: These cases involve children who have committed law violations that would be considered crimes if committed by an adult. </li>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Dependency: These are cases that concern family situations where allegations of abuse or neglect have been made and the juvenile court intervenes to protect the family\u2019s children. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <h2>The Court\u2019s Authority </h2>\r\n          <p>The juvenile court has broad authority in juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. It can remove children from their homes, order their placement with relatives or in foster care or group homes, terminate parental rights, create new parental rights, and join various agencies to provide needed services. In delinquency cases, the juvenile court can also order children to be confined in locked facilities, including the California Youth Authority. </p>\r\n          <p>Whenever the court decides to remove a child from his or her home, placement and responsibility for that child is given to a governmental agency. It can also order services to be provided that will allow children to remain in their homes safely. In delinquency and status offense cases, that agency is the probation department; in dependency (abuse and neglect) cases, the agency is the county welfare department. The agency is responsible for meeting the health and educational needs of the child, as well as providing the care, treatment, and guidance the child may need.</p>\r\n          <h2>Legal Help </h2>\r\n          <p>Because these decisions are so serious and affect fundamental rights, it is very important that, if a juvenile case involves you or your child, you consult an attorney who can advise you more specifically about the court process as it relates to your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Your Right to an Attorney </h2>\r\n          <p>The child in a delinquency case has a right to an attorney; a parent in a dependency (abuse and neglect) case has a right to an attorney; and the court must appoint an attorney for the child in an abuse and neglect case unless the court finds the child would not benefit from the appointment.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Juvenile Court"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/juvenile.shtml"},

The grand jury concept has a long history and has adapted throughout the centuries to meet the needs and conditions of each time period. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p> Grand juries perform two primary roles. One is to evaluate the validity of charges being brought by a prosecutor, if the charges are not reviewed by a judge, to ensure that they are not frivolous or ungrounded. The other is to inquire into, and investigate if necessary, the operations of local government agencies and officials to ensure that activities are valid and services are efficiently and legally provided. In both instances, the secrecy of the grand jury's deliberations is a common thread that ensures independent and objective consideration of facts brought before it.</p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   <div class=\"simpleModule\">\r\n\r\n          \r\n            <!--- Begin Accordion --->\r\n             \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2Wrap\">\r\n                                        \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n                        document.write(\"<div class=\\\"controls2\\\"><a class=\\\"expandall\\\" href=\\#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.expandall('trigger2'); return false\\\">expand all<\\/a> <a class=\\\"collapseall\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.collapseall('trigger2'); return false\\\">collapse all<\\/a><\\/div>\");\r\n                        </script>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                \r\n   \r\n     <div class=\"trigger2\">An Invitation to Participate in the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> You can make a difference </h4>\r\n                      <p> Participation in Grand Jury investigation and discussion is a rich and rewarding experience. It is an opportunity to get an intimate look at how government works and to make informed and valuable recommendations regarding possible improvements. It is also an opportunity to serve with fellow county residents and to discover how a body of nineteen citizens reaches consensus. This is the heart of the democratic process, and service on the Grand Jury is a valuable way to learn, to contribute and to make a difference in your community. </p>\r\n                      <h4> Selection Process </h4>\r\n                      <p> Applications for grand jury service are sent to citizens of Glenn County by random selection through the use of voter registration and Department of Motor Vehicles lists. Citizens are also encouraged to volunteer to be considered as a prospective Grand Juror through public announcements through local radio and television stations and press. Every effort is made to recruit both men and women from all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups and age groups.\r\n                        \r\n                        Applications for grand jury service are given an initial review by Court Administration to ensure that each applicant meets the qualifications to be a grand juror as outlined in this pamphlet. After the initial review, qualified applicants are scheduled for an interview with the Grand Jury Selection Committee. The Selection Committee is comprised of the Court\u2019s Judges, Executive Officer, and the incoming and outgoing Grand Jury forepersons.\r\n                        \r\n                        After the interviews, qualified prospective Grand Jurors are summoned to appear in court where all names are placed in a lottery draw. The first 19 names chosen become the next Glenn County Grand Jury. The remaining names are drawn to provide alternates.\r\n                        \r\n                        Shortly before the beginning of the term of service, July 1 through June 30, a training program is conducted for incoming Grand Jurors pursuant to PC \u00a7914(b). The foreperson is selected by the Presiding Judge.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h4>Commitment/Compensation </h4>\r\n                      <p>The complex, diverse responsibilities of grand jurors make it necessary to give a serious commitment to the time requirements. The usual work schedule is one to two evenings per month, although some day or weekend meetings may be required. However, each grand jury sets the dates and times of their meetings that is most convenient for all members. Jurors are provided with meeting facilities and parking, as well as a stipend. Reimbursement for the mileage to and from meetings is allowed at the regular county rate. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Application and Contact Information </h4>\r\n                      <p>For more information or a grand jury application, please write, email, or call:<br>\r\n                        \r\n                        Superior Court of California,                     County of Glenn<br>\r\n                        Office of the Jury Commissioner<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988<br>\r\n                        (530) 934-6382<br>\r\n                        <a href=\"mailto:askus@glenncourts.com\">askus@glenncourts.com</a></p>\r\n                      <p> <a href=\"documents/Juror%20Questionnaire%20Website.pdf\">Download the pdf version of the questionnaire here</a> If you are interested in participating in the Grand Jury process, please send a completed questionnaire to: </p>\r\n                      <p>Court Administrative Assistant<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">History of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> Before American Development </h4>\r\n                      <p> Some historians believe that the earliest versions of the grand jury existed in Athens, where the Greeks used citizen groups to develop accusations. Others find traces of the concept in all the Teutonic peoples, including early Anglo-Saxons. For example, the concept was employed in the early Scandinavian countries. Evidence also exists that the early French developed the \"King's Audit\" involving citizens who were sworn and required to provide fiscal information related to the operation of the kingdom.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>However, most commentators believe that the grand jury arose as an institution in England. In the first millennium, English individuals prosecuted criminals, with the king personally involved in the system. Under the Doom Law of Anglo-Saxon King Aethelred (980-1016), a dozen landowners were appointed to investigate alleged crimes. In 1166, King Henry II established a system of local informers (twelve men from every one hundred) to identify those who were \"suspected of\" various crimes. If the suspects survived their \"trials by ordeal\", they paid fines to the King. However, the \"informers\" were fined if they failed to indict any suspect, or even enough suspects. After 1188, they became tax collectors as well, and after the reign of Henry III, they were charged with looking into the condition and maintenance of public works. </p>\r\n                      <p> The Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215, did not mention the grand jury specifically, but did establish various procedures to ensure fairness in the dispensation of justice. Thereafter, until the mid-1300's, the 12-man juries served both to present indictments and also to rule on the validity of charges. During Edward III's reign, from 1312-1377, the 12 individuals were replaced by 24 knights, called \"le grande inquest\", and the 12 became a \"petit jury\" responsible only for declaring innocent or guilty verdicts. </p>\r\n                      <p> Ultimately, in the 1600's, the English grand jury developed as a process to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that an accused individual was guilty of a crime. Grand juries reached their English pinnacle of citizen protectors in 1681, when they refused to indict enemies of King Charles II for alleged crimes. (Ironically, English laws establishing grand juries were repealed in 1933.)</p>\r\n                      <h4>Early American Development</h4>\r\n                      <p>The use of juries in earliest colonial history was limited. In the New Haven colony, for example, religious beliefs resulted in the residents eliminating trial by jury because there was no reference to juries in the laws of Moses. However, procedures similar to grand juries were used to hear criminal charges of larceny (Boston, 1644), holding a disorderly meeting (Plymouth, 1651), and witchcraft (Pennsylvania, 1683). In the early 1600's, colonial representatives of the English monarchs made laws and prosecuted violators. The first grand juries recommended civil charges against those crown agents, thus establishing themselves as representatives of the governed, similar to grand juries today. The first grand juries also looked into government misconduct or neglect. For example, the first colonial grand jury, established in Massachusetts in 1635, \"presented\" town officials for neglecting to repair stocks, as well as considering cases of murder, robbery and spousal abuse. </p>\r\n                      <p>Other early grand juries performed a variety of administrative functions, including audits of county funds (New Jersey), inspections of public buildings (Carolinas), and review of taxes and public works (Virginia). Virginia grand juries also investigated whether each family planted two acres of corn per person.</p>\r\n                      <p>In the Colonies, grand juries were considering criminal accusations and investigating government officials and activities, but with a populist view. Grand jurors included popular leaders such as Paul Revere and John Hancock's brother. These grand juries played a critical role in the pre-Revolutionary period: for example, three grand juries refused to indict John Peter Zenger, whose newspaper criticized the royal governor's actions in New York (he ultimately was prosecuted by the provincial attorney, defended by Alexander Hamilton, and acquitted). Grand juries also denounced arbitrary royal intrusions on citizens' rights, refused to indict the leaders against the Stamp Act of 1765, and refused to bring libel charges against the editors of the Boston Gazette in 1766. </p>\r\n                      <p>After the Revolutionary War ended, the new federal constitution did not include a grand jury. Early American leaders such as John Hancock and James Madison objected. Thereafter, the grand jury was included in the Bill of Rights, as part of the Fifth Amendment, which states, \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger...\" </p>\r\n                      <p>From then, until today, the federal grand jury remains an integral part of the justice system, used by federal prosecutors for a variety of potential crimes. In 1801, a federal grand jury indicted Colonel Aaron Burr for treason. Most recently, federal grand juries considered allegations related to the Oklahoma City and New York Trade Center bombings, President Clinton's conduct both before and during his term of office, and the recent claims of wrong-doing by former California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and some associates. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Adaptation by the States </h4>\r\n                      <p>As the various states were admitted to the Union and adopted their legal and operating procedures, almost every one initially included some reliance on grand juries for either (or both) review of criminal indictments or inquiries into government activities. Some states' grand juries were very active in administrative affairs, even including recommending new laws. Others carried out investigations of government officials; one Tennessee grand jury indicted the entire state court of appeals and another opposed a judge's reappointment on the grounds of \"mental imbecility\". </p>\r\n                      <p>Throughout this state-by-state development, the underlying concept remained the same: ordinary citizens, neighbors, and others on grand juries were a necessary part of government to ensure that public prosecutors were not swayed by personal or political prejudices, and that government officials efficiently and effectively performed their jobs. </p>\r\n                      <p>Since the mid-1800's, grand juries have been criticized as ineffective or out-of-date by a number of reformers because they were slow, lacked expertise, and on other grounds. Others criticized the \"star chamber\" atmosphere of secret hearings without customary due process rights. However, these complaints were offset by effective grand jury investigations, including those of the Boss Tweed ring in New York City (1871) and racketeering charges brought by a grand jury assisted by Thomas Dewey in the 1930's. Since the nineteenth century, various minor and major changes have been made in grand jury selection, procedures, and qualifications, often resulting in fairer and more efficient jury operations. </p>\r\n                      <p>Today, all states except Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, may use grand juries to indict and begin criminal trials. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia require that grand jury indictments be used for certain-more serious-crimes. California and twenty-four other states make use of grand jury indictments optional. All states and the District of Columbia use grand juries for investigative purposes. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">The Grand Jury's Role</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Prosecutions </h4>\r\n                      <p>Although the American grand jury originally was conceived as a protector of ordinary citizens by other ordinary citizens, the fairness of its criminal operations has been questioned by various commentators and judges. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas stated, \"It is, indeed, common knowledge that the Grand Jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the Government, is now a tool of the Executive.\" Some even have referred to it as a \"rubber stamp\" for prosecutors. In the criminal system, the California constitution and laws provide that felony prosecutions are initiated only after a determination that there is \"probable cause\" to believe that specific individuals committed specific crimes. This is done either by \"information\" presented for examination and approval by a judge, or by indictment after a grand jury hearing and vote. In either case, the purpose of the objective review is to prevent overzealous prosecutors from unjustified, groundless, or unfair prosecutions when \"probable cause\" does not exist. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury operates without providing many fundamental rights common in court hearings and trials. For example, the defendant has neither the right to present evidence to the grand jury or cross-examine the witnesses against him or her. Only the prosecutor may present evidence, and the defendant has no right to counsel, even if required to testify. Even judges generally are excluded, leaving the grand jurors to rely on the prosecutor for all information. One early study indicated that 95% of all cases brought to the grand jury resulted in indictments, raising questions about the value of this review because the grand jury is not able to adequately evaluate the evidence presented only by the district attorney. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The role of the grand jury in civil investigations presents an interesting twist: the original (English) grand juries served to aid the government in finding and prosecuting private citizens' misdeeds; now, these juries investigate and accuse public figures, defending individual citizens' rights and expectations. Grand juries, both federal and state, may investigate criminal activity or non-criminal activities. In California, for example, the grand jury can investigate any activity by a public official (other than court), which violates a state law, and many other activities, as long as they occur within the county of the grand jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>State grand juries, but not federal grand juries, can investigate any non-criminal activity and report and make recommendations based on the results of the investigation. These investigations commonly include reviewing the operation and condition of jails and prisons, investigating the conduct of local public officials, and other similar matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The results of these investigations may be criminal charges, recommendations for new laws, or merely reports to the public identifying problems but proposing no specific solutions.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Duties of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <h4>\r\n                            \r\n                      Government Watchdog</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In California today, provisions of the Penal Code to require the grand jury:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Investigate and report on the accounts, records, operations, and functions of district, city and county government and public officials (Penal Code \u00a7 925 &amp; 925a); it may also inquire into the affairs of joint powers agencies located in the county. </li>\r\n  <li>Inquire into the condition and management of all correctional facilities within the county (Penal Code \u00a7 919(b)). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The grand jury may investigate or inquire into county matters of civil concern, such as the needs of county officers, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of the several offices. </p>\r\n<h4>Powers permitted to the grand jury include:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Free access, at reasonable times, to public prisons; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine all public records within the county;</li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine books and records of <ul>\r\n  <li>any incorporated city, or joint powers agency located in the county; </li>\r\n  <li>certain redevelopment agencies and housing authorities; </li>\r\n  <li>special-purpose assessing or taxing districts wholly or partly within the county; &amp; </li>\r\n  <li>non-profit corporations established by or operated on behalf of a public entity; </li></ul></li>\r\n  <li>The authority to investigate and report on operations and methods of performing duties of any such city, county, or joint powers agency and to make recommendations as deemed proper; </li>\r\n  <li>The ability, with permission of the Superior Court, to hire experts such as auditors and accountants; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to inquire into the sale, transfer and ownership of lands which might or should escheat to the state. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Note:\t</strong>The grand jury has no authority to investigate the courts or the acts or commissions of any judge or judicial employee.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Criminal Indictments</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Constitution permits criminal trial on the basis of indictment by a grand jury or by information after the district attorney recommends prosecution and a judge agrees that facts exist which warrant prosecution. In addition, under \u00a7 917 of the Penal Code, \"the grand jury may inquire into all public offenses committed or triable within the county, and present them to the court by indictment.\" In actual practice, grand juries seldom initiate such inquiries; rather, such offenses are generally brought to the grand jury by the district attorney, who asks for and generally receives an indictment, upon presentation of adequate facts.\r\n\r\n</p><p>According to the California Grand Jurors Association, the district attorney much more frequently bypasses the grand jury and uses the process known as a preliminary hearing. A 1954 survey of California district attorneys listed the following factors as influential in the decision to seek a grand jury indictment rather than using the preliminary hearing: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>High public interest in the case; </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that a preliminary hearing would take more time than a grand jury hearing; </li>\r\n  <li>The necessity for calling children or witnesses who would be subject to cross-examination at a preliminary hearing;</li>\r\n  <li>The existence of a weak or doubtful case which the district attorney wishes to test; </li>\r\n  <li>Cases involving malfeasance in office; and </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that witnesses are in a state prison. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A more recent study adds the following reasons for using the grand jury: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Cases where the defendant cannot be located and the time limit under the statute of limitations is about to expire, </li>\r\n  <li>Where the secrecy of the grand jury may allow defendants to be charged and taken into custody before they can pose potential danger to a witness's safety or flee from the jurisdiction, </li>\r\n  <li>The need to protect the identity of undercover agents, </li>\r\n  <li>And the ability to test a witness before a jury. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>From 1978 until 1990, grand juries were seldom used for indictments. A California Supreme Court ruling required holding preliminary hearings even if grand jury indictments were obtained. In 1990, a constitutional amendment made significant alterations in California criminal law and court procedures, including a provision that defendants were not entitled to preliminary hearings if indicted by a grand jury. As noted above, recent statutes (Penal Code \u00a7 904.6) give district attorneys the option of using special grand juries chosen from the regular jury pool to handle criminal cases and thus ensure indictment by those who represent a cross section of the community. Although the law allows criminal indictments to be brought by a grand jury, in practice, the District Attorney generally prefers to use the speedier preliminary hearing process.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">California Grand Juries</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> An Overview </h4>\r\n                      <p>Grand Juries are impaneled in every county in California. Article I, \u00a723 of the California Constitution states: \"a grand jury shall be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each county.\" Depending on a county's population, a specified number of citizens ranging from 11 to 23 in each of California's 58 counties are empowered to investigate and report on various activities of county and city government. The rules governing the makeup, organization, powers and duties of grand juries in California are found in the California Penal Code \u00a7888-939. Recent changes in the Penal Code (\u00a7904.6, 1991) permit any county to have an additional grand jury at the discretion of the presiding judge of the superior court. </p>\r\n                      <p>The statutes permit some variation in the manner and time of selection of jurors and require only that the term of service be for one year and coincide with the County's fiscal year. Qualifications for grand jurors are outlined in Penal Code \u00a7 893. This section requires the prospective grand juror be at least 18 years old, in possession of their natural faculties and have sufficient knowledge of the English language. In Sacramento County, each grand jury begins its term July 1 and ends its service June 30 of the following year. Throughout the State, prospective grand jurors in each county are chosen through a lengthy process that includes application, screening by the jury commissioner from Department of Motor Vehicle Records, voter rolls, and nomination of interested persons by Superior Court Judges. A thorough background check is made on all interested persons and list of qualified candidates is submitted to the judges for review and approval. Since some members of the existing grand jury may be carried over for a second term, the number of names drawn will equal those needed to provide a grand jury of 19 members. (The law allows for a grand jury of 23 in counties with greater than four million population and for 11 members in counties with less than 20,000 population. (Penal Code \u00a7888.2)) It has been the practice in many counties to advertise widely and to encourage many people to apply for the grand jury. Because grand jury service requires the devotion and commitment for only a token payment, it is desirable for grand jurors to have an interest in community affairs and be open-minded with a true concern for the views of others. Grand jurors also should posses some investigative skills and be able to take good notes and write and type reports. A good knowledge of the functions and responsibilities of city and county government is also helpful. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Investigation of Complaints and Accusations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury also is likely to receive a number of citizen complaints, many of which involve operations of county or city agencies or special districts. Whether the complaint is civil or criminal, rules of secrecy apply, and during the course of its investigation, the grand jury may not divulge the subject or methods of inquiry. The subject of the investigation and the methods of inquiry are only revealed when the final report is published. Privileged or confidential material is not included in the grand jury reports. Thus the names of those questioned and facts that might lead to the identity of a person who provided information to the grand jury are not released. \u00a7 919(c) of the Penal Code requires the grand jury to inquire into the willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Where misconduct is found, the grand jury may file an accusation leading to a trial. If the official is convicted, the person is thereby removed from office. Very few of these accusations are filed. Frequently, if there is misconduct in office, it is of a criminal nature, and an indictment rather than an accusation would be issued. It is also possible that an official would resign rather than face an accusation. The grand jury may file an accusatory pleading against a corporation doing business in its county of jurisdiction (Penal Code \u00a7 892). In a report published by the California Grand Jurors Association, misconduct in office could include any of the following: </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Nonfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The failure to act where duty requires an act; or</li>\r\n                        <li>Neglect or refusal, without sufficient cause or excuse, to do that which is the officer's legal duty to do, whether willfully or through malice; or </li>\r\n                        <li>Willful neglect of duty. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Misfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The improper or doing of an act that a person might lawfully do; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a duty or act that one ought to do or has a right to do, but in manner such as to infringe upon the rights of others. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Malfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The performance of an act that is positively unlawful or wrong; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a wrongful act that the person has no legal right to do. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Reports</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> State Law requires that each grand jury submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the presiding judge of the Superior Court. </p>\r\n                      <p>A report, just as an accusation or an indictment, must be approved by at least 12 of the 19 grand jurors (15 if it is a 23 member jury). With so many possible investigations and a term limited to a single year, it is necessary for each grand jury to make hard decisions as to what it wishes to undertake during the term. Except for mandated duties to report on the financial condition of the county and on the conditions of county jails, the grand jury discretion in determining its agenda. Most grand juries divide into committees for conducting investigations and for writing reports, but there seems to be a wide variation between counties as to the number and structure of committees; it is up to each grand jury to determine its own method of operation within the parameters of the law. </p>\r\n                      <p>Government agencies that are the subject of reports are required by law to respond to specific grand jury findings and recommendations. However, the grand jury has no enforcement power, and the agencies are under no legal obligation to carry out the recommendations. While some recommendations are ignored, others are followed; particularly those that suggest greater efficiency for operations and that do not require the expenditure of large sums of money. Grand jury criticisms of public officials and agencies frequently attract press attention, bringing greater community awareness of what is happening in public agencies. Many grand jurors believe that public officials tend to be more accountable when they know an impartial; outside body is looking over their collective shoulders. </p>\r\n                      <p>The California Grand Jurors Association (CGJA) (www.cgja.org), a statewide organization of former grand jurors has begun a program of identifying and indexing grand jury reports in each county with the hope of establishing a state archive of annual reports. The State Library also maintains an archive of grand jury reports from all counties. CGJA also monitors and occasionally proposes or endorses proposed laws to conserve and improve the grand jury as an important institution of local government. It offers services to those grand juries that may request advice and help in preparing informational manuals and in providing orientation for incoming jurors. Some members of the CGJA now provide orientation programs for those counties that request this service. </p>\r\n                      <p>While surrounded by secrecy before publication, grand jury reports become public documents when signed by the grand jury foreman and approved by the grand jury's advisory judge. Copies are sent: to all targeted government agencies, to interested officials, to public and private groups and individuals and to the press. At the end of the year, bound or loose-leaf copies of all reports are placed in all public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Online Grand Jury Reports</h4>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2016-2017_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2016 - 2017 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2015-2016_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2015 - 2016 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2014-2015_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2014 - 2015 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2013-2014_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2013 - 2014 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2012-2013_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2012 - 2013 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2011-2012_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2011 - 2012 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2010-2011_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2010 - 2011 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2009-2010_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2009 - 2010 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2007-2008_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2007 - 2008 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2006-2007_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2006 - 2007 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2005-2006_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2005 - 2006 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2004-2005_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2004 - 2005 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2003-2004_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2003 - 2004 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2002-2003_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2002 - 2003 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Report-Revised_Response_02-23.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report-Revised</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2000-2001_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2000 - 2001 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Criminal/Civil Functions</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The major functions of a grand jury are divided into criminal indictments and civil investigations. While the same panel in Glenn County executes both functions, the civil investigation portion requires the majority of the jury\u2019s time. California Penal Code section 904.0(a) allows the presiding judge of Superior Court to impanel one additional grand jury. The additional grand jury would have sole jurisdiction to return criminal indictments.</p>\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Indictments </h4>\r\n                      <p>The District Attorney will bring the majority of cases that are presented to the grand jury; however, the State Attorney General or a Special Prosecutor may present a case. The responsibility of the grand jury does not extend beyond the determination of whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has committed such crime.\r\n                        \r\n                        Criminal indictment hearings are conducted in secrecy to protect witnesses and defendants in cases of no indictment. During a criminal investigation only District Attorney representatives and a court reporter are allowed in the jury room, with a few exceptions. No person other than a grand juror may be present during deliberations or voting. An indictment can be returned only if a minimum of 12 jurors agrees. </p>\r\n                      <p>Historically, the grand jury indictment process is used for cases where: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Public officials, employees, or police officers are involved </li>\r\n                        <li>Statute of limitations is a concern</li>\r\n                        <li>The indictment is complex and must be presented over a long period of time </li>\r\n                        <li>Grand jury subpoena powers are necessary </li>\r\n                        <li>Secrecy and non-adversary nature for sensitive cases are needed, such as cases involving children or rape victims </li>\r\n                        <li>Criminal indictments are extremely rare in Glenn County. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The civil, or \u201cwatchdog\u201d, responsibilities of the grand jury encompass the examination of all aspects of county government, including special districts, to ensure that the county is being governed honestly and efficiently and that county monies are being handled appropriately. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury is mandated by law to inquire into the conditions and management of public jails.\r\n                        \r\n                        The grand jury may conduct investigations on public agencies and on the administration and affairs of any city within the county, as well as examine books and records of redevelopment agencies. It is also appropriate for any private citizen, county official or county employee to present a written complaint to the grand jury for investigation. </p>\r\n                      <p>During its term, the grand jury selects the government affairs it wishes to investigate. These investigations are generally conducted by committees, which correspond with the primary functions of the county. Committees may ask for support and advice from the Superior Court Presiding Judge, District Attorney, County Counsel, Attorney General, or outside consultants. </p>\r\n                      <p>On the last day of each year of service, the grand jury is required by law to submit all final reports to the Presiding Judge. These reports include all studies and investigations conducted by the grand jury during its term, with appropriate recommendations. Copies of individual reports are submitted to each county entity investigated, with instructions that response to findings/recommendations be made by the responsible governing body within 60 or 90 days. </p>\r\n                      <p>Past grand jury reports are available for inspection by the public at most public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Complaint Form</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <p>\r\nDownload a <a href=\"documents/Grand_Jury_Complaint_Form.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Jury complaint form</a>. </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Qualifications</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The law states grand jury applicants must have these qualifications: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Citizen of the United States, 18 years of age or older</li>\r\n                        <li>Resident of state and county for at least one year prior to being selected </li>\r\n                        <li>In possession of natural faculties, ordinary intelligence, sound judgment, fair character </li>\r\n                        <li>Possess sufficient knowledge of the English language </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Applicants are disqualified if any of the following apply: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as a trial juror in any court in the state</li>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as an elected public official </li>\r\n                        <li>Discharged as a grand juror in any court in the state within one year </li>\r\n                        <li>Convicted of malfeasance in office or any felony or other high crime </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Beyond the legal requirements, several other qualifications are desirable for a grand juror:</p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>General knowledge of the functions, authorities, and responsibilities of county and city government and of other civil entities </li>\r\n                        <li>Research abilities, including ability to read and comprehend complex material, a background in accessing/analyzing facts and experience in report writing </li>\r\n                        <li>Background in group/committee work </li>\r\n                        <li>Good to excellent health </li>\r\n                        <li>Respect and objectivity concerning the positions and views of others </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n<!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Grand Jury"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/grand-jury.shtml"},

After the court of appeal has made its decision, the party may seek review in the California Supreme Court. Death penalty appeals are decided only by the Supreme Court. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Thousands of cases are appealed in California every year. They include criminal convictions; civil cases involving personal injury, contract, employment, real estate, probate, dissolution of marriage, child custody and many other issues; and administrative matters, such as worker's compensation. In the vast majority of these cases, the decision of the court of appeal is final. The Supreme Court grants review of only a few Court of Appeal decisions when necessary to resolve novel or disputed questions of law. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>Proceedings in appellate courts are very different from those in trial courts. In trial courts, a judge or jury hears the testimony of witnesses, reviews physical evidence, exhibits and documents, and applies the law and reaches a decision. Appellate courts, on the other hand, do not decide an appeal by taking new evidence or reassessing the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the trial court. Rather, they review the written record to determine if the trial court properly interpreted the law and used the correct procedures when considering the case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>To ensure cases are examined from several perspectives, each Supreme Court case is heard by all seven of the high court's justices, while each court of appeal case is considered by a panel of three justices. Supreme and appellate court justices are assisted in their review by the parties' written and oral arguments. To decide a case in either court, a majority of the justices must agree. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All justices are bound to apply the law whether or not they personally agree with it. Justices may not substitute their own ideas for what the law should be, but are bound by the federal and state constitutions, statutes, and other rules and regulations legislated by those with the authority to do so, including the state legislature and voters by initiative. Judges must enforce all laws without being swayed by public opinion. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges to \"be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism ...\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, and is designed specifically to foster judges' independence from improper external pressures. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The California Constitution generally requires appellate courts to decide a case in a written opinion setting forth the facts and rules of law upon which the decision is made. By constitutional mandate, the decision must be issued within 90 days after the case has been taken under submission or the justices hearing the case cannot receive their pay. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Important appellate opinions are published in law books and by electronic means, which are available to judges, lawyers, the public, and the news media. Such opinions become rules of law, which govern future disputes. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In 1996-1997, 18,802 criminal, juvenile, and civil cases were noticed for appeal. During the same period, appellate courts affirmed 95 percent of the criminal and juvenile cases, and 76 percent of the civil cases they heard. Whenever an appellate court reverses, it almost always allows the trial court to rehear the case using the correct law and procedures. Before you file an appeal, you should read this information carefully. You are responsible for preparing all documents and doing any legal research you feel is necessary. The clerk cannot advise you on any legal issues or advise you as to the content of any papers required. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>When you appeal, you are asking the appellate court to review a decision of the trial judge because you disagree with it. The court cannot review questions of fact. It can only decide if there was an error of law that was serious enough to have prevented you from having a fair trial. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The appellate court cannot retry the case. No witnesses can be heard, and the court cannot consider any evidence that was not presented at trial. It cannot consider conflicting evidence or choose to believe you instead of the other witnesses. The trial judge's determinations of credibility and conflicts in the evidence are binding in the appellate court. The appellate court can only look at the record on appeal and decide whether the trial judge's decision in the case is supported by substantial evidence. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The things you must do to be sure your appeal will be heard are in the California Rules of Court, California Rules 101 through 108 apply to all appeals. Rules 121 through 144 apply to civil appeals, and Rules 182 through 191apply to appeals of traffic infractions and criminal cases. If you do not follow the rules carefully, you may lose the chance to have your appeal considered. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All papers filed with the court must be served on the opposing party or that party's lawyer and must have a valid proof of service attached. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>The most important act in an appeal is filing the written notice of appeal. This notice must be filed with the Appeals unit before the deadline. There are many time limits and regulations in proceeding with an appeal.

For cases tried in a limited (municipal level) jurisdiction (small claims, limited civil, unlawful detainer, traffic, misdemeanors), the court of appeal is the Superior Court. For cases tried in a general (superior level) jurisdiction (general civil, family law, probate, juvenile, felony), the court of appeal is the Third District Court of Appeals.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Ascertained:</strong>\u00a0Determined; proved to be true.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Bailiff:</strong>\u00a0An officer from the sheriff's department who maintains courtroom order and jury custody.

If a lawyer wishes to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" for that juror. Challenges, or reasons to dismiss a juror, are of two kinds:</p>\r\n      \t\t        <blockquote>\r\n      \t\t          <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"522\">\r\n      \t\t            <tbody>\r\n      \t\t              <tr>\r\n      \t\t                <td valign=\"top\" width=\"105\"><strong>a.

These are called peremptory challenges. Each side may ask the judge to excuse particular jurors. If a juror is excused, this does not imply something bad and does not mean the juror is not competent in any way. It frequently happens that a prospective juror will be excused in a certain case and later accepted in another. The number of peremptory challenges have been established by the Legislature.</td>\r\n   \t\t                  </tr>\r\n   \t\t                </tbody>\r\n   \t\t              </table>\r\n   \t\t            </blockquote>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Civil case/civil suit:</strong>\u00a0A lawsuit is called a civil case when it is between two or more individuals or corporations involved in a dispute and usually seeking a judgment awarding monetary damages. A civil case is an action brought to enforce, redress, or protect private rights. Civil actions include:</p>\r\n      \t\t        <ul>\r\n      \t\t          <li>General Civil (seeking damages over $25,000)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Limited Civil (seeking damages under $25,000)\u00a0Family Law</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Probate</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Unlawful Detainer (landlord/tenant disputes)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Small Claims (seeking damages under $5,000)</li>\r\n   \t\t            </ul>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Common law:\u00a0</strong>The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from constitutions or statutes.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Compulsory:</strong>\u00a0Compelled; mandated by legal process or by statute.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Constitution:</strong>\u00a0The fundamental law of our nation. It establishes the character and organization of America's sovereign power and the manner of its exercise. Also, the document that contains the guiding rules and principles, the descriptions of the power of the federal government, and the essential rights of the people.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Controversy:</strong>\u00a0A disagreement or a dispute that requires a definitive determination of how the law applies to the facts that are asserted to be true.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Counsel:</strong>\u00a0One or more lawyers who represent a client.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p>Criminal prosecution/criminal case: The act of pursuing a criminal trial, where the state charges someone with a crime. A criminal case is an action brought by the government against a person who has broken the law. Criminal cases are separated into three main categories; felony, misdemeanors, and infractions</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Degree of proof:</strong>\u00a0The amount of proof necessary to prove a case. In a criminal case, such proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Deliberations:</strong>\u00a0This occurs after a trial when a jury goes into its assigned private room to think about and discuss evidence and testimony to help it reach a verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Directed verdict:</strong>\u00a0After evidence has been presented and if no issue of fact remains for the jury to determine, the judge will tell the jury what verdict to return. The jury must return that verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Disqualification (juror)</strong>: The condition of having been rendered not qualified to serve.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Eligible/eligibility ( for jury duty):</strong>\u00a0Every person who is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the respective county, able to understand the English language, not currently serving on any other jury, and who has not been convicted of a felony is eligible to serve as a juror (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 203).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong>\u00a0Any type of legal proof presented at trial through witnesses, records, and/or exhibits.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exemptions/excuses/postponements (for jury service):</strong>\u00a0By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong>\u00a0Document or material object produced and identified in court as evidence in a case. Each of these documents or objects is ordinarily given an identifying letter or number in alphabetical or numerical sequence when it is offered as evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Felon:</strong>\u00a0A person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Foreperson:</strong>\u00a0Often called the \"presiding juror.\" At the beginning of deliberations, the jury votes to select one of its members to be the foreperson. The jury foreperson's duty is to preside and see that discussion during deliberations is carried on in a free and orderly manner, that the case and issues are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given a chance to participate in the discussion. As the deliberations conclude, the foreperson counts the votes and completes and signs the verdict form.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Impartial:</strong>\u00a0Without bias, prejudice, or other preconception. The members of a jury should have no opinion about or vested interest in a case at the start of the trial and should base their verdict only on competent legal evidence presented during the trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong>\u00a0The guidelines given by the judge at the beginning and end of a trial that explain what the law in the case is and how the jurors should evaluate the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury pool:</strong>\u00a0The group of prospective qualified jurors appearing for assignment to trial jury panels.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury summons:</strong>\u00a0The papers sent to potential jurors that require their attendance in court for possible service on a jury. California courts summon jurors to the courthouse no more than once in any given 12-month period.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury selection:</strong>\u00a0The process by which jurors for a particular trial are selected from the larger group of potential jurors summoned to the courthouse. Once the jurors arrive in the courtroom, the judge and lawyers ask the jurors questions for the purpose of determining whether jurors are free of bias, or prejudice, or anything might interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Juvenile Case:</strong>\u00a0Juvenile cases are those involving minors under the age of 18 years. These are separated into two main categories--Juvenile Delinquency for minors who have broken the law and Juvenile Dependency for minors who have been removed from the home and/or care of their parents or guardians.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Litigants:</strong>\u00a0Any persons or groups engaged in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>One-day/one-trial:</strong>\u00a0California courts have adopted the one-day or one-trial system. One day or one trial means that prospective jurors have to come to the court only once. If you are not chosen for a trial, then your term of service is complete for one year. If you do serve on a jury, you will not be required to report for jury service for at least another 12 months.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Pending:</strong>\u00a0In process; not yet decided.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Perjury:</strong>\u00a0A false statement made willfully and knowingly while under oath in a court proceeding.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Polled/polling:</strong>\u00a0Calling the names of the jurors and having them state what their final verdict is before it is recorded.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postpone:</strong>\u00a0To put off until later.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postponement:</strong>\u00a0Permission to put off serving as a juror until a later time. A postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called for jury service. See also exemptions/excuses.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Preponderance of the evidence:</strong>\u00a0Greater weight of evidence, or evidence that is more credible and convincing. Refers to the amount of proof required to win in a civil case. It is that degree of proof that is more probable than not (lower standard than that required in criminal cases).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Propound:</strong>\u00a0To offer for discussion or consideration.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prosecutions:</strong>\u00a0Criminal legal proceedings.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prospective:</strong>\u00a0Likely to come about, relating to or effective in the future.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Reimbursement:</strong>\u00a0Specific payment for out-of-pocket expenses. For example, the court pays jurors mileage, based on the IRS standards, (one way) for travel.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Sequestration:</strong>\u00a0A sequestered jury is usually housed together at night in a hotel and prohibited from contacting people outside of the court. Sequestration rarely occurs and is meant for jurors' protection. It may be used to keep jurors away from the media during a controversial trial where widespread news coverage could influence a juror's decision. In rare cases, there may be attempts to influence the jurors' deliberation.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Source list:</strong>\u00a0The list or lists from which citizens are selected to receive a jury summons in California. Potential jurors are selected randomly from the voter registration list and the Department of Motor Vehicles' lists of drivers.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Subpoena:</strong>\u00a0A subpoena is an official order to attend court at a stated time. The most common use of the subpoena is to summon witnesses to court for the purpose of testifying in a trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Testimony:</strong>\u00a0Evidence given by a witness under oath.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Traffic Case:</strong>\u00a0Traffic cases are those in which citations have been issued for a violation of traffic laws.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unable to serve</strong>: If you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called, a postponement may be available. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unanimous:</strong>\u00a0There are 12 people on a jury trial, except when the parties in civil or misdemeanor cases agree that there may be fewer than 12. A decision is unanimous when the full jury in a criminal case or three-quarters of the jury in a civil case have agreed upon the verdict. Once a verdict has been reached, the jury is brought back into the courtroom. The verdict must be in writing, signed by the foreperson, and must be read to the jury by the court clerk or the judge.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong>\u00a0The formal decision or finding made by a jury, which has been impaneled and sworn for the trial of a case, and reported to the court.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Voir dire:</strong>\u00a0Translated from French, the legal phrase means \"to speak the truth\" or \"to see them say.\" Voir dire is the preliminary examination of prospective jurors by a judge or lawyer to decide whether that person can serve on a particular jury.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Witness:</strong>\u00a0One who can give a firsthand account of something seen, heard, or experienced.</p>\r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Glossary of Terms & Legal Dictionary"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/self-help/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/self-help/glossary.shtml"},

Within that environment, one of the most significant relationships is that between the judges and the CEO. Judges ultimately are responsible for effective administration of the court. Frequently, constitutions and statutes make this duty clear; other times, the duty is implied. In either case, effective administration takes place when the judiciary and the CEO manage the court together. Effective systems of administration provide for the participation of all judges in the development of policy and planning for the court. Through the collaborative efforts of the CEO and the presiding judge, court policy is implemented, monitored, and facilitated.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO serves the dual function of increasing the amount of time a judge has for adjudication and bringing professional management knowledge and capability to the judiciary. In courts where judges lack administrative support they must divide their time between judicial and administrative functions. With mounting caseloads and increased pressure for more case dispositions, judges have little time to direct the day-to-day operations of the court system, plan for the implementation of new technologies, or integrate new procedures that can improve system performance. A court administrator can help the court develop and recommend policies and coordinated work processes that enhance system performance, while maintaining the independence of individual judges. CEOs can also help develop goals for the courts, prepare and execute budgets, recognize changes in caseload or demographics that will affect court operations and funding, manage court personnel and programs for their professional development, improve jury systems and services to the public, implement automated information systems, plan for space requirements, administrate systems for assessing and collecting fees, and establish procedures for handling information requests.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Court Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>Personal and Professional Skill</p>\r\n                          <p>A Court Executive Officer (CEO) is selected by a process that includes a majority vote of all the judges in a multi-judge court. In very large urban courts, a selection committee chaired by the presiding judge and representative of the entire bench can select the CEO. The position of Court Executive Officer is the most important non-judicial position in the court; therefore, each judge participates in the hiring process.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO\u2019s needs to posses an ability to analyze problems, formulate recommendations, build consensus, empower people, and foster change are among the attributes of a successful administrator. A successful CEO working in a complex court environment exhibits the following:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Learning Skills: Learning to learn is basic to all other skills; court administrators are required to respond quickly, adapt to changes in technologies and workload, and enable the development of appropriate responses to organizational changes.</li>\r\n                            <li>Communication: Speaking, Writing, and Listening Skills: Most of our daily routine is taken up with communication in one form or another. As work processes and procedures are negotiated, monitored, and changed, the ability to communicate clearly is fundamental to success.</li>\r\n                            <li>Adaptability: Problem Solving and Creativity Skills: In any rapidly changing environment, successful CEOs create opportunity and exploit new technologies or create new organizational relationships to overcome barriers to court system goals.</li>\r\n                            <li>Motivation and Goal-setting Skills: The ability to link court system goals and performance measures with work processes and employee reward and staff development programs.</li>\r\n                            <li>Interpersonal Skills: The ability to relate to individuals, both within and outside the court system, through appropriate styles that communicate trust, understanding, and loyalty to court system values.</li>\r\n                            <li>Negotiation Skills: The ability to overcome conflict through problem solving and collaboration strategies that focuses on organizational goals and values as arbiters of conflict and choice.</li>\r\n                            <li>Teamwork Skills: The ability and confidence to empower court system employees and inter-organizational staff to take responsibility for court system goals and performance standards.</li>\r\n                            <li>Leadership Skills: The ability to clearly communicate organizational values that influence others to take individual responsibility for achieving court system values and goals and to instill the confidence to change and adapt as changes in work load, funding, or technology reshape existing work processes or relationships.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p>Ideally, the CEO will combine the technical skills of a manager with knowledge of public and business administration and an understanding of the duties and the problems peculiar to the courts.</p>\r\n                          <p>Specifically, the CEO should have completed considerable study of public and business administration or have on-the-job experience in these fields. To this end, many courts require that a court administrator hold a degree in business, public, or judicial administration or be a graduate of the Court Executive Development Program of the Institute for Court Management. In addition, the court administrator should be familiar with courts and government as well as with business organization and operations.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>Professional Standards</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>The Court Executive Officer should have these qualifications:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Administrative ability demonstrated by substantial experience in progressively more responsible management positions in government or the private sector;</li>\r\n                            <li>Experience in current business and management techniques, including use and implementation of automated data processing;</li>\r\n                            <li>A demonstrated ability to plan and conduct studies to improve court administration and to prepare recommendations and implement them when approved;</li>\r\n                            <li>Good judgment, understanding, and tact ability to maintain working relationships with other courts and with local, state, and federal government officials, members of the bar, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>The ability to conduct conferences and meetings and communicate clearly in writing and speech to employees, the judges of the courts, representatives of government agencies, industry, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>Formal training in court administration and managerial experience, in addition to familiarity with court procedures;</li>\r\n                            <li>Creativity, leadership, planning ability, organizational skills, initiative, decisiveness, and dedication to making productive changes in operating methods;</li>\r\n                            <li>High ethical standards;</li>\r\n                            <li>A fundamental understanding of and loyalty to the court's purpose and goals as a separate branch of government;</li>\r\n                            <li>Knowledge of and ability to adapt to the unique court environment;</li>\r\n                            <li>Ability to follow as well as to lead in the implementation of policies created by the judiciary;</li>\r\n                            <li>Respect for the requirements of confidentiality and loyalty when entrusted with the confidence of the judges;</li>\r\n                            <li>Educational qualifications related directly to the functions that the CEO's position requires.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A graduate degree in judicial administration, public administration, business administration, or law with management training or experience in a court for three or more years with proven competency in administration and management.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A bachelor's degree in one of the fields named above or three years of experience in a responsible elected or appointed position, with training in court administration.                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Court Reporter</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n\r\n                                  What Does a Court Reporter Do?\r\n                                  <p>A court reporter, officially known as a certified shorthand reporter, must record everything that is said during official court proceedings.

It is the job of the judge in that courtroom to be in charge of everything that happens to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In every case, the judge must be impartial. That means the judge must be able to be fair to everyone involved in the case. They are called the parties. If the judge thinks there is any reason for the parties to question whether the judge can be fair, the judge must tell the parties about this reason. If there is any reason that the judge might not be able to be impartial, such as the judge is a friend of one of the parties, the judge must withdraw from the case. That is called a recusal.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a criminal case, the judge schedules an arraignment, at which time the charges that have been filed are explained to the defendant. The defendant may admit to the charges and plead guilty, or the defendant may ask for a trial. There might be a settlement of the case with a plea agreement, also called a plea bargain, in which the prosecutor recommends that the judge impose a sentence that is less than the maximum possible sentence in exchange for the defendant's plea of guilty to the charges; or the defendant might agree to plead guilty to a less serious charge. If case is not settled, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a civil case, the judge will usually meet with the lawyers to see if the case can be resolved or settled without having a trial. In a civil case, the settlement usually involves the payment of money in exchange for voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. If the civil case cannot be settled between the parties, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A party may request that the judge make legal rulings about the case before the trial by filing a motion. To make any rulings on a case, the judge must understand the facts and know the laws that apply to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A trial is the time when the parties present evidence to prove their case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must present the evidence to prove the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. In a civil case, the person who filed the case must present the evidence to prove the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>If a trial is held, the judge is responsible for:</p>\r\n                                  <ul>\r\n                                    <li>Setting the hours of the trial;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Keeping order in the courtroom;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Presiding over the selection of jurors;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Permitting the presentation of evidence through testimony of witnesses or the introduction of exhibits;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Deciding on what evidence can be considered by the jurors in making their decision;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Explaining the law that applies to the case to the jurors so they can deliberate, and</li>\r\n                                    <li>Sentencing the defendant if the defendant is found guilty in a criminal case.</li>\r\n                                  </ul>\r\n                                  <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Judge?</strong></p>\r\n                                  <p>There are two ways to become a judge in California.

The Governor's staff reviews the application. Most successful candidates also submit letters of support from friends, including other lawyers, judges, law school professors, and others who know about the candidate\u2019s qualifications.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the Governor\u2019s office thinks the applicant has sufficient merit, the State Bar of California Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation is asked to review the candidate's application. The commission solicits additional information and recommendations from other lawyers and judges who know the applicant.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the applicant receives a high rating, the Governor\u2019s staff will submit the application to the Governor, who then decides whether to grant the appointment.</li>\r\n                                    <li>A lawyer may also seek a judicial appointment by running for election.

In a courtroom, however, the lawyer\u2019s role is narrowed to a more specific purpose.</p>\r\n                          <p>Generally, there are two sides in a courtroom proceeding.

The functions of the office are defined by the county charter and by California state law. The attorneys and other staff employed by the office render legal services to individuals who are accused of public offenses, and who cannot afford to retain the services of a private attorney. They also represent any person under the age of 18 who is facing juvenile delinquency proceedings, or regarding whom the state has instituted wardship proceedings because of habitual truancy or incorrigibility. The public defender represents individuals who are involuntarily detained in medical facilities in a variety of mental health proceedings because of purported mental disabilities, those as to whom conservatorship proceedings have been instituted because they are alleged to be gravely disabled, and patients whose competency to refuse medical treatment is challenged. Finally, the public defender's office represents individuals who are subject to contempt proceedings for violation of court orders, such as child support and child visitation or custody orders.

In some courts, the next step would be a meeting with your attorney (if you have one); in others you would proceed to a hearing before a judge. In some courts, the mediator is asked to make a recommendation to the court about what is best for the children. The judge considers this recommendation and may or may not follow it. Ask your mediator how it works in your court. Please remember that no matter how sensitive or understanding a judge or commissioner may be, that person does not know your children the way you do.

The court offers forms that you may fill out for enforcement of a judgment. If you do not have information regarding the judgment debtor\u2019s income or property, you may make the debtor come to court to answer questions. This is done by filing an Order of Examination. There is a filing fee. Once you have the financial information needed, you may file a \"Writ of Execution\". There is a fee for issuance of a Writ of Execution. A Writ of Execution is a court paper, which tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to pay your claim. The kinds of property an officer may be able to take: wages, bank accounts, automobiles, and business property or rental income. The Sheriff will charge a fee to execute the writ. If the debtor owns property you may want to record an abstract to place a lien so that you will be able to be paid if the property is purchased, sold or financed. There is an issuance fee. The abstract is recorded with the County Recorder in the county where the property is located. The Recorder will charge a fee to have the abstract recorded.<a href=\"../forms-filing/docs/copy-and-forms-fee.pdf\"> Download a printable civil filing\u00a0and appearance fees list</a></li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: I won my small claims case and the judgment debtor has paid me in full.

In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided may be deemed to have elected a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. Your driver's license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency (Pen.

{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <h2>Landlord Requirements </h2>\r\n          <h3>Unlawful detainer proceedings</h3>\r\n          <p>When a landlord wants to end a tenancy involuntarily after the tenant has taken possession of the rental premises, the landlord must take certain legal steps to do so. An unlawful detainer proceeding is an accelerated method for recovery of possession of leased premises. It is a limited proceeding designed to permit a landlord to recover possession of real property from a tenant who is wrongfully in possession. (Because of its summary character, an unlawful detainer action is not a suitable vehicle for trying complicated ownership issues involving allegations of fraud.) </p>\r\n          <p> Like civil actions generally, unlawful detainer actions are initiated by the filing of a complaint, issuance of a summons, and service of the complaint and summons on the defendant.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Landlords in California must first follow all requirements for eviction proceedings prescribed in California statutes and follow any applicable local ordinances. </p>\r\n          <h3>Three-day and 30-day notice</h3>\r\n          <p>An unlawful detainer proceeding is usually initiated by the landlord's serving a 3-day or 30-day notice on the tenant. A landlord must strictly comply with the statutory requirements for service of the notice to quit the leased premises. \r\n            \r\n            Among 3-day notices are notices to quit (\"leave\"), notices to perform covenant or quit, and notices to pay rent or quit. Three-day notices to quit are used when a tenant has allegedly breached (\"broken\") a covenant (\"agreement\") in the lease that cannot be cured. A 3-day notice to perform covenant or quit is used when there has been a curable breach other than nonpayment of rent, for example, breach of a covenant not to assign or sublet the premises. The most common notice is a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. </p>\r\n          <p>A landlord\u2019s choice to declare a forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement on a 3-day notice is nullified and the lease or rental agreement remains in effect if the tenant performs within 3 days after service of the notice or if the landlord waives the breach after service of the notice. </p>\r\n          <p>A 30-day notice to quit usually addresses a situation in which the landlord wishes to terminate an indefinite-term tenancy (that is, a holdover tenant or a tenant on a month-to-month tenancy). The landlord and tenant may provide by agreement at the time the tenancy is created that either party may terminate the tenancy on less than 30 days\u2019 notice, but the agreement may not provide for less than 7 days\u2019 notice. </p>\r\n          <p>No notice is required for an unlawful detainer action based on the expiration of a fixed-term tenancy, nor is notice required when a tenant occupies the property as part of his or her employment (for example, as an apartment manager), which has been terminated. </p>\r\n          <h3>Filing a complaint</h3>\r\n          <p>After you have complied with applicable notice requirements, the residential eviction process is begun by filing a complaint with the local court. To file a complaint, you may use Complaint Unlawful Detainer (Form 982.1(90)) and file the form with the local court, paying the applicable filing fee. </p>\r\n          <h3>Obtaining and serving the summons</h3>\r\n          <p>You then obtain a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) from the local court and must serve the summons on the tenant, adhering to appropriate service requirements. </p>\r\n          <h2>Tenant Requirements </h2>\r\n          <p>Responding to the complaint. As a tenant, if you are served with a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) and complaint concerning an eviction, you must respond to the summons. You may use Judicial Council Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer, to respond and must file the answer form with the local court that issued the summons. You must also pay a filing fee when filing the answer form, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. </p>\r\n          <p>Download fee waiver forms and instructions by clicking on the form number below:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a17.pdf\">982(a)(17)</a> Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a18.pdf\">982(a)(18)</a> Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>The following forms are used for later filings in your case: </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a20.pdf\">982(a)(20)</a> Application for Waiver of Additional Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a181.pdf\">982(a)(18.1)</a> Court Fees and Costs Order on Application for Waiver of Additional </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are confidential forms for the court. Do not have them served on the other party.</p>\r\n          <p>If there is more than one tenant, or defendant, listed in the complaint, each tenant must respond separately or a default judgment may be entered against the tenants who do not file an answer. Two tenants can share one answer form, but each must sign the answer form individually and pay a separate filing fee. If you are filing the answer for yourself only, put your name on line 1 of the answer form. If you are filing the answer for yourself and another tenant named in the complaint, put both your names on line 1. </p>\r\n          <p>Each tenant named in the complaint has five days after the summons is served to file an answer form at the court that issued the summons. (The five-day response time includes Saturdays and Sundays, but excludes all judicial holidays. If the last day for filing a response is a Saturday or Sunday, the tenant has until close of business on the next court day to file a response.) </p>\r\n          <p>A letter or phone call does not serve as a response. The answer must be on the proper legal form \u2014 Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer \u2014 in order for the court to hear the case.</p>\r\n          <p>If an answer is not filed on time, the tenant may lose the case, be evicted, and have his or her wages, money, and property taken by the landlord without further warning from the court. </p>\r\n          <p>The tenant\u2019s time to respond to a complaint for unlawful detainer is not affected by the tenant's quitting of the leased premises.</p>\r\n          <p>Serving the answer and completing a proof of service form: Before you file your answer with the court, you first have to make sure that a copy of the answer is served on the landlord of the property. This means that a copy of the answer along with a proof of service form must be given to the attorney for the landlord or, if the landlord is not represented by an attorney, to the landlord. It can be served by mail or hand delivered, but only by a person who is at least 18 years of age and is not a plaintiff or defendant in the case. </p>\r\n          <p> A Proof of Service form is used to show the court that a copy of your answer was sent to the other party in the case before you filed the original answer. It does not have to be received by the other party before you file; it must only be put in the mail. The Proof of Service must be signed by a person over 18 who is not a party to the case. This means that neither you, nor any other tenant in the case, can sign the Proof of Service form. You can obtain a Proof of Service form from your local superior court or from books containing general legal forms available from legal publishers or bookstores. </p>\r\n          <p> The court will not accept an answer for filing without a signed Proof of Service form attached. </p>\r\n          <p>You may want to call an attorney for assistance. If you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Landlord / Tenant / Unlawful Detainer"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/landlord-tenant.shtml"},
{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <p>The juvenile court is a division of the superior court. It handles two types of cases: </p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Delinquency: These cases involve children who have committed law violations that would be considered crimes if committed by an adult. </li>\r\n            <li>Juvenile Dependency: These are cases that concern family situations where allegations of abuse or neglect have been made and the juvenile court intervenes to protect the family\u2019s children. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <h2>The Court\u2019s Authority </h2>\r\n          <p>The juvenile court has broad authority in juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. It can remove children from their homes, order their placement with relatives or in foster care or group homes, terminate parental rights, create new parental rights, and join various agencies to provide needed services. In delinquency cases, the juvenile court can also order children to be confined in locked facilities, including the California Youth Authority. </p>\r\n          <p>Whenever the court decides to remove a child from his or her home, placement and responsibility for that child is given to a governmental agency. It can also order services to be provided that will allow children to remain in their homes safely. In delinquency and status offense cases, that agency is the probation department; in dependency (abuse and neglect) cases, the agency is the county welfare department.

If a bench warrant is issued, you need to report to the court for felony/misdemeanor warrant surrender (call for day and time), or turn yourself into local law enforcement. </p>\r\n\r\n          <h2>Public Defender</h2>\r\n          <p>The Public Defender may be appointed to represent defendants involved in a criminal case who cannot afford to hire an attorney.

{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n        \r\n      \t\t<p>The information contained in this page does not apply to appeals from a small claims traffic judgment.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In cases other than death penalty appeals, small claims or traffic, the party seeks appellate review in the court of appeal. After the court of appeal has made its decision, the party may seek review in the California Supreme Court. Death penalty appeals are decided only by the Supreme Court. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Thousands of cases are appealed in California every year. They include criminal convictions; civil cases involving personal injury, contract, employment, real estate, probate, dissolution of marriage, child custody and many other issues; and administrative matters, such as worker's compensation. In the vast majority of these cases, the decision of the court of appeal is final. The Supreme Court grants review of only a few Court of Appeal decisions when necessary to resolve novel or disputed questions of law. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>Proceedings in appellate courts are very different from those in trial courts. In trial courts, a judge or jury hears the testimony of witnesses, reviews physical evidence, exhibits and documents, and applies the law and reaches a decision. Appellate courts, on the other hand, do not decide an appeal by taking new evidence or reassessing the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the trial court. Rather, they review the written record to determine if the trial court properly interpreted the law and used the correct procedures when considering the case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>To ensure cases are examined from several perspectives, each Supreme Court case is heard by all seven of the high court's justices, while each court of appeal case is considered by a panel of three justices. Supreme and appellate court justices are assisted in their review by the parties' written and oral arguments. To decide a case in either court, a majority of the justices must agree. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All justices are bound to apply the law whether or not they personally agree with it. Justices may not substitute their own ideas for what the law should be, but are bound by the federal and state constitutions, statutes, and other rules and regulations legislated by those with the authority to do so, including the state legislature and voters by initiative. Judges must enforce all laws without being swayed by public opinion. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges to \"be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism ...\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, and is designed specifically to foster judges' independence from improper external pressures. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The California Constitution generally requires appellate courts to decide a case in a written opinion setting forth the facts and rules of law upon which the decision is made. By constitutional mandate, the decision must be issued within 90 days after the case has been taken under submission or the justices hearing the case cannot receive their pay. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Important appellate opinions are published in law books and by electronic means, which are available to judges, lawyers, the public, and the news media. Such opinions become rules of law, which govern future disputes. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In 1996-1997, 18,802 criminal, juvenile, and civil cases were noticed for appeal. During the same period, appellate courts affirmed 95 percent of the criminal and juvenile cases, and 76 percent of the civil cases they heard. Whenever an appellate court reverses, it almost always allows the trial court to rehear the case using the correct law and procedures. Before you file an appeal, you should read this information carefully. You are responsible for preparing all documents and doing any legal research you feel is necessary. The clerk cannot advise you on any legal issues or advise you as to the content of any papers required. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>When you appeal, you are asking the appellate court to review a decision of the trial judge because you disagree with it. The court cannot review questions of fact. It can only decide if there was an error of law that was serious enough to have prevented you from having a fair trial. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The appellate court cannot retry the case. No witnesses can be heard, and the court cannot consider any evidence that was not presented at trial. It cannot consider conflicting evidence or choose to believe you instead of the other witnesses. The trial judge's determinations of credibility and conflicts in the evidence are binding in the appellate court. The appellate court can only look at the record on appeal and decide whether the trial judge's decision in the case is supported by substantial evidence. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The things you must do to be sure your appeal will be heard are in the California Rules of Court, California Rules 101 through 108 apply to all appeals. Rules 121 through 144 apply to civil appeals, and Rules 182 through 191apply to appeals of traffic infractions and criminal cases. If you do not follow the rules carefully, you may lose the chance to have your appeal considered. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All papers filed with the court must be served on the opposing party or that party's lawyer and must have a valid proof of service attached. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>The most important act in an appeal is filing the written notice of appeal. This notice must be filed with the Appeals unit before the deadline. There are many time limits and regulations in proceeding with an appeal. Please read the California Rules of Court to verify that you meet the time limits for every step. Failure to meet some time limits may result in dismissal of your appeal. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Note: If you do not file the notice of appeal on time, the appellate court cannot consider your case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Appeals"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/appeals.shtml"},

The judge will also tell you what the lawsuit is about. </p>\r\n                      <p>Next, the judge and the attorneys will question each of the people in the jury box to find out if you can be fair and impartial in this particular case. </p>\r\n                      <p>One of the attorneys may \u201cchallenge you for cause.\u201d This means the attorney will ask the judge to excuse you from the jury for a specific legal reason. </p>\r\n                      <p>Each lawyer has an unlimited number of challenges for cause.\r\n                        \r\n                        Each attorney has the right to a certain number of peremptory challenges.

You should not guess or speculate about things not discussed in court, but you can draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence presented.</p>\r\n                      <p>It is important to take the case you are deciding seriously. After all, if you were a party in the case, it would be important to you, and you would want the jury to give it serious consideration even if the controversy appears less significant to others. </p>\r\n                      <p>All jurors should deliberate and vote on each issue to be decided in the case. When it is time to count votes, it is the foreperson's duty to see that this is done properly. In a civil case, the judge will tell you how many jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict. In a criminal case, the unanimous agreement of all 12 jurors is required. If the required number of jurors agree on each issue to be decided, the foreperson will sign and date the verdict, advise the bailiff or court attendant, and return with the signed verdict and any unsigned verdict forms from prior votes to the courtroom. </p>\r\n                      <p>If a jury cannot arrive at a verdict within a reasonable time and indicates to the judge that there is no possibility that they can reach a verdict, the judge, in his or her discretion, may dismiss the jury. This situation is a mistrial, sometimes referred to as a \"hung jury,\" and may mean the case goes to trial again with a new jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>When you have reached a verdict the foreperson will record your verdict on an official form. The bailiff will tell the judge you are ready and you will return to the jury box. The judge will ask if you reached a verdict. The foreperson will answer, handing the written verdict to the bailiff who in turn will hand it to the judge. The clerk will read the verdict aloud. Sometimes one of the parties will ask that the jury be polled. This means that the clerk will ask each juror if this is his or her own verdict. The jury service will then be complete. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Three Main Steps of a Jury Trial</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> California juries have been providing outstanding service and have set a high standard. The state of California and your trial judge thank you and all jurors for giving generously of your time and for taking jury duty seriously.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 1: Selection of a Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>When a jury trial is about to begin, the trial court judge requests a panel of prospective jurors to be sent to the courtroom from the jury assembly room so that the jury selection process can begin. After reporting to a courtroom, the prospective jurors are first required to swear that they will truthfully answer all questions asked about their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>The perjury admonishment, which basically requires potential jurors to tell the truth when answering the questions, is read as follows: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will accurately and truthfully answer, under penalty of perjury, all questions propounded to you concerning your qualifications and competency to serve as a trial juror in the matter pending before this court, and that failure to do so may subject you to criminal prosecution? </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>The court clerk calls 12 or more jurors to take seats in the jury box. The judge speaks to the jurors, telling them the names of the people involved in the case and their attorneys and stating what the case is about. The judge and the attorneys ask jurors questions to determine if the jurors are free of bias (prejudice) or whether there is any reason why any of them cannot be fair and impartial; this process is called voir dire. It is important to ask questions if you do not understand a question. Also, each juror is obligated to follow the law as explained by the judge; if you cannot follow the law, you need to let the judge know.</p>\r\n                      <p>The law lets the judge and the lawyers excuse individual jurors from service in a particular case for various reasons. If a lawyer wants to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" to excuse the juror. Challenges can be for cause or peremptory. There are two types of juror challenges: a challenge for cause and a peremptory challenge. The process of questioning and excusing jurors continues until 12 persons are accepted as jurors for the trial. Alternate jurors may also be selected. The judge and attorneys agree that these jurors are qualified to decide impartially and intelligently the factual issues in the case. When the selection of the jury is completed, the jurors take the following oath: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court, and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court?\" </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>As a juror you should think seriously about the oath before taking it. The oath means you give your word to reach your verdict upon only the evidence presented in the trial and the court's instructions about the law. You cannot consider any other evidence or instruction other than those given by the court in the case before you. Remember that your role as a juror is as important as the judge's in making sure that justice is done. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 2: The Trial </h2>\r\n                      <h3>Jurors' duties during the trial: </h3>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not </strong>talk to others about the case. This responsibility requires that you not talk at all with the lawyers, witnesses, or anyone else connected with the case. The lawyers understand this rule. You will find that, even at the risk of seeming rude or unfriendly, the lawyers must avoid even casual conversation with you. In order to prevent even the appearance of improper conversation, a wise policy for you to follow is to avoid any contact with the lawyers or the parties. You also cannot talk to anybody about the case. There are important reasons for this: all cases must be decided only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you were to discuss the facts of the case or your impressions of it with your family, friends, or with any other person, you might hear their ideas and might be influenced by people who do not know all the facts. If you believe that someone has tried to speak to you about the case, you must report what happened to the judge by contacting the bailiff immediately. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> make up your mind before hearing all the evidence. It is also your duty not to form or express an opinion about the case to anyone. This means that you keep an open mind until you have heard the evidence from all sides and the case is given to the jury for deliberation. Only then may you discuss it with your fellow jurors and even then only when all jurors are present. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> conduct your own investigation of the case. It would also be a violation of your duty as a juror to conduct any investigation of the case. As a juror you must not become an amateur detective. For example, you must not visit the scene of an accident, an alleged crime, or any event or transaction involved in the case. You should not conduct experiments or consult any other person or reference works for additional information. If the judge feels that an inspection of a place is necessary or will be helpful, he or she will arrange and supervise an inspection by the whole jury. If you have a question about the evidence, let the judge know by handing a note to the bailiff and he or she will make a decision about your question. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Attorneys' opening statements</strong>: As the trial begins, the lawyer for the plaintiff in a civil case or the prosecutor in a criminal case may make an opening statement telling you what they expect the evidence to show. The defendant's lawyer may also choose to give an opening statement after the plaintiff's attorney or prosecutor, telling you what the defense expects the evidence to show. The lawyers' statements are not evidence. Their purpose is to give you the framework of the case, the points of conflict, and the issues of the case that you will need to decide. Be careful that you do not let any of the information presented in the opening statements become evidence in your mind. Remember that the lawyers' statements are only their versions of what happened, not evidence. </p>\r\n                      <p> <strong>Presentation of evidence</strong>: Evidence may be presented by the attorneys in the form of a written document or an object (a gun, another weapon, a photograph, an x-ray, or some other physical thing). These are called exhibits. Evidence may also include the testimony of witnesses under oath in the courtroom.\r\n                        \r\n                        Attorneys' closing statements: After all the evidence has been reviewed in court, lawyers for each side may present their final summary of the case, sometimes referred to as an argument. The lawyers can talk about reasons and make conclusions, but these are not evidence; they are efforts to persuade you. You should listen to these statements carefully and consider them thoughtfully, but you must form your own opinion about the outcome of the case based upon all evidence presented. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Judge's Instructions on the Law</strong>: Either before or after the closing arguments by the lawyers, the judge will explain the law that applies to the case to you. This is the judge's instruction to the jury. You have to apply that law to the facts, as you have heard them, in arriving at your verdict. You must consider all of the instructions and give them equal consideration. Keep in mind that you must follow the law as the judge states it to you. If the judge gives you an instruction that seems different from what you read here or another instruction given at another trial, you must accept the instruction given by the judge of the case you are deciding as correct and be guided by the judge's statement only. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>When considering the evidence</strong>, an important difference exists between civil and criminal cases in the degree of proof required to sustain an accusation. In a criminal case, the defendant, in order to be convicted, must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, a party suing another has to prove that charge by a preponderance of the evidence. In every trial, the judge carefully explains the degree of proof required to reach a verdict. You should pay careful attention to the instructions on the degree of proof. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 3: Deliberations by the Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>After closing statements by the attorneys and the judge's instructions on the law, the bailiff or court attendant will take you to the jury room for deliberations. Your first duty when entering the jury room is to select a foreperson. The jury should carefully select a well-qualified foreperson. The foreperson's duty is to see that discussion happens in a free and orderly manner, that the issues you must decide are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given an opportunity to participate. </p>\r\n                      <p>After you enter the jury room for deliberations, the exhibits that you are to consider are given to you. If you are not given written instruction from the judge on the law, you may request them. If you feel you need further instructions or to have certain testimony read back to you, inform the judge through the bailiff or the court attendant. Since these purposes can be accomplished only by returning everyone (including parties and lawyers) to the courtroom, you should not make these requests lightly. The procedure usually takes time, but this delay is understandable if you seriously believe doing so is necessary or helpful to you in reaching a verdict. There is a booklet, \"Behind Closed Doors\" that can assist jurors with the format of their deliberation. It is published by the American Judicature Society, which can be contacted at <a href=\"http://www.ajs.org\">http://www.ajs.org</a>. </p>\r\n                      <p>Quite often in the jury room the jurors may argue and have a difference of opinion. When this occurs, each juror should try to express his or her opinion and the reasoning supporting it. It would be wrong for a juror to refuse to listen to the arguments and opinions of the others or to deny another juror the right to express an opinion. Remember that jurors are not advocates, but impartial judges of the facts. By carefully considering each juror's opinion and the reasons behind it, it is usually possible for the jurors to reach a verdict. A juror should not hesitate to change his or her mind when there is a good reason. But each juror should maintain his or her position unless conscientiously persuaded to change that opinion by the other jurors. Following a full and free discussion with fellow jurors, each juror should vote only according to his or her own honest convictions. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">General Information</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li> <strong>Restrooms</strong> are located in the hallway in the Orland Branch and on the second floor of the courthouse in Willows. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Public Telephones</strong> are located in the hallway at the Orland Branch and across the street in Memorial Hall in Willows.</li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Children, relatives or friends</strong> are not permitted. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror Eligibility:</strong> All U.S. citizens who are over the age of 18, a resident of the county that issued the jury summons, and are able to understand the English language are eligible to serve on a jury in the State of California. Of these people, only convicted felons, meaning anyone who has been found guilty of a serious crime, cannot serve. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror summons</strong>: Once you have received a jury summons, read the instructions carefully. If you have any questions, contact the jury office. Be sure to bring your summons with you when your report to court. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Term of Service</strong>: Jury service is a \"one day or one trial\" term of service. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you will serve for the duration of that one trial. Average length of a trial is two (2) to five (5) days, although trials can run longer. If you are not selected for a trial during your service day, your service obligation shall be complete for one year. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Compensation</strong>: California allows payment of $15 a day plus mileage, at the current rate according to federal standards, per mile one way for jury service. For reimbursement, ask your local jury office or the bailiff in the courtroom for more specific information for your local court. Although this is only a fraction of the cost of each juror's time, the courts are working with the Legislature and the Governor to increase juror fees. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There is ample parking at both courthouse locations. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Security</strong>: People entering the courthouse may be searched. Purses, briefcases, or other containers may also be searched. Weapons are prohibited in the courthouse facility. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Postponements</strong>: By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Orientation</strong>: You will be instructed regarding your jury service when you first appear. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Job and School</strong>: Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. This is the law. Section 230 of the California Labor Code is intended to prevent any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service and who has given reasonable notice of when the employee is to serve. Notice is generally considered reasonable if it is given as soon as possible once the employee has been summoned. The California Education Code (\u00a7\u00a7 44037 and 8 7036) and Rule of Court 5.5(d)(7) protect teachers, other school employees, and students as well. If you are harassed or fired, contact your local jury office or the judge assigned to your trial. If your employer has harassed you because of your service on a jury, contact the Department of Industrial Relation's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. You must complete a complaint form and turn it in to the Labor Board within six months from when the harassment happened. Remember to keep any certificate issued by the court clerk to prove that you served and for your employer's records. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Excuses for Undue Hardship</strong>: In certain serious cases, the jury commissioner or the judge may excuse you for up to one year. These are called undue hardship cases. If you have a personal situation that stops you from being able to serve, write that reason on your summons and mail it back or call the jury office. When listing reasons such as medical, job, or dependent care issues, be prepared to provide documentation to receive a postponement and not an excuse. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Disqualification</strong>: A person is disqualified or temporarily excused if he or she is a felon, nonresident, non-citizen, under a conservatorship, or in some cases, a peace officer. If you fall into one of these categories, contact the jury office to explain your situation. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Although we attempt to make jury service as convenient and efficient as possible, jurors should be advised that there will be times you will spend waiting. You may wish to bring something to occupy your time. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n              <!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Trial Jury"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/trial-jury.shtml"},

There are three levels of severity of traffic violations: infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. Most traffic violations are infractions, but some, like vehicular manslaughter, are felonies. </p>\r\n          <p>Infractions are not punishable by jail or prison and are not subject to trial by jury; the punishment is a fine. Penalties for infractions can be as much as $200 or more for common traffic infractions including speeding, running a red light or stop sign.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Misdemeanors, such as driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, can carry penalties of as much as $2,000 or more and/or confinement in a city or county jail. The maximum penalty allowed in California for a misdemeanor is one year in county jail and/or a fine.\r\n            Felonies are punishable by formal probation or formal confinement in state prison. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infractions </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common infractions are moving violations without injury, such as speeding and running a red light. Drivers stopped for moving violations are usually released after they sign a Notice to Appear, printed on the ticket, agreeing to appear at a set date and time. The traffic ticket provides information about when to appear in court. Drivers charged with an infraction that want to admit guilt can avoid a court appearance by paying the fine in person or by mail. If drivers do not appear or pay the traffic fine within the authorized time, their driver?s license may be suspended. Usually they will not be able to renew their vehicle registration until they have paid all outstanding parking tickets and administrative costs in full. Drivers who plead not guilty and request a trial may be required to post bail or sign a written document to appear in court. If they fail to appear, they may be charged with the additional misdemeanor of violating their agreement to appear. In this case, a warrant may be issued for their arrest and their driving privilege may also be suspended. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Misdemeanors </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common misdemeanors are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and driving without a valid license. In some cases, drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be taken into custody. Drivers charged with almost all other traffic misdemeanors and infractions usually will not be taken into custody but will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear in court. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infraction Trials </h2>\r\n          <p>If a driver has been charged with a traffic violation they do not have the right to trial by a jury. The defendant may offer opposing evidence, argue the law, present supporting witnesses and other evidence, and cross-examine the law enforcement officer who issued the citation. </p>\r\n          <p>If a driver is judged \"not guilty,\" the bail will be refunded if previously posted. Drivers judged \"guilty\" must pay the fine or, in a serious misdemeanor, serve the sentence. People who willfully do not pay the fine and/or do not serve the sentence within the time authorized may be charged with contempt of court or failure to pay a fine, in which case court collections unit will begin to pursue the court-ordered debt from the individual. </p>\r\n          <h2>Driving Under the Influence </h2>\r\n          <p>The penalties for driving under the influence vary depending on the number of a driver's prior convictions for this offense.</p>\r\n          <p>A first-time violation can be punished by a jail term of not more than six months, a fine and penalty ranging from $1,000 to $2,700, and suspension or restriction of driving privileges for six months. Drivers with three DUI convictions within seven years normally receive jail terms of not less than 120 days nor more than one-year and a fine and penalty of not less than $1,053, and no more than $2,700. The person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be revoked for three years. </p>\r\n          <p>Drivers charged with a DUI must appear in court for an arraignment and may be requested to post bail. Bail can vary from $300 to $15,000. Whenever the possible sentences include jail time, the court, upon request, will appoint an attorney for drivers who cannot afford to hire one. </p>\r\n          <h2>How Parking Violations Are Settled </h2>\r\n          <p>Since July 1, 1993, legislation transferred the adjudication (settling) of parking tickets from the courts to the issuing agencies.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Only cases that are appealed because they cannot be settled after hearings with the issuing agency will come to the court.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <h2>Mandatory Automobile Insurance Law </h2>\r\n          <p>Under the mandatory insurance law, all drivers must carry evidence of financial responsibility and must provide that evidence to an officer on request. A driver who fails to provide proof of insurance on request by an officer during a traffic stop is guilty of an infraction.</p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant claims an inability to pay both the insurance and the fine or other financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to make installment payments or to pay the entire amount within a specified time. If you request installment payments, an additional $35.00 will be charged to your account.The court may reduce or waive the fine based on a defendant's inability to pay, but the Legislature specifically declared that it is in the interest of justice that the minimum fines for violations be enforced. In a case of extreme financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to substitute community service in place of payment of the fine. </p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant fails to pay the fine (or complete community service), the court may issue a warrant for the separate offense of failure to pay or obey a court order, may assess civil assessments, may impose additional fines, and may suspend the defendant's driving privileges. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Tickets </h2>\r\n          <p>If you are charged with a traffic misdemeanor or infraction, you usually will not be taken into custody. Instead, you will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear, often called a \"citation\" or a \"ticket.\" You may be taken into custody if you refuse to sign the citation; the arresting law enforcement officer also signs it.

In other words, the plaintiff has no right of appeal. So if you should lose, that's probably the end of the case. However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again. </p>\r\n          <p>If you are the plaintiff and a Claim of Defendant is filed (the defendant sues you on the same case) and you have a judgment against you, you may file an appeal on that decision. </p>\r\n          <h2>Small Claims Advisor </h2>\r\n          <p>The Self-Help Center has all of the small claim forms and is able to assist you with filling out the forms. </p>\r\n          <h2>Filing Your Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>Go to the court closest to you and obtain a small claims packet for filing your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Monetary Limits </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court has a monetary limit, called a jurisdictional limit, on the amount of money damages that a person can claim. The most you can ask for is $5,000; however, you are limited to filing no more than two claims anywhere in the State of California for over $2,500 in one calendar year. You may file an unlimited amount of claims for $2,500 or less. </p>\r\n          <h2>Role of the Court Clerk </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court clerks can answer many kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited by law to give legal advice. The Small Claims Advisory Clinic provides legal advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant. See the other helpful web sites listed below for information on filing a claim. </p>\r\n          <h2> Web Site to Help You File a Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>The California Courts\u2019 web site [http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm] has a section full of information needed to go through the process of a small claims suit, including an overview, forms, rules, tips, and much more. </p>\r\n          <h2>What to Expect in Court </h2>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Come to court organized and prepared.</li>\r\n            <li>Arrive promptly at your assigned court time; if you arrive late, your case may be heard without you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring enough photocopies of all your evidence for each party and the judge. </li>\r\n            <li>Any copies submitted to the judge the day of trial may not be returned to you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring all your witnesses. </li>\r\n            <li>If both parties are present, meaning both the plaintiff and the defendant, you will be asked to go into the hallway to exchange and review any documents that will be submitted to the judge as evidence. This must be done prior to the case being heard. </li>\r\n            <li>Have all your documents ready and in chronological order when your case is called. </li>\r\n            <li>There will be several other cases assigned to the same time as yours so you may have to wait to have your case heard. </li>\r\n            <li>You may be asked to sign a stipulation allowing a pro-tem judge (temporary judge) to hear your case. If you do not wish to have a temporary judge hear your case, your case may be continued to a date when there is a commissioner or judge of the Superior Court to hear your case. </li>\r\n            <li>You may decline a temporary judge when you file your claim and avoid a continuance to another date. </li>\r\n            <li>When your case is called, you will stand at a podium in front of the superior court judge or a pro-tem judge. You will be asked to present your evidence and give your testimony. Always address the judge and not the other party.\r\n              Usually, the plaintiff will give his/her testimony first and then the defendant.</li>\r\n            <li>The judge will probably ask questions to further his/her understanding of the case. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are the only party to appear at the trial and you are the plaintiff, you still must prove your case. Do not expect to \"automatically\" win your case if the other party does not appear. </li>\r\n            <li>The proceedings will not be recorded by a court reporter or by any other type of recording. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are not fluent in the English language, you must bring an interpreter with you. Small Claims courts do not provide interpreters. </li>\r\n            <li> The judge will usually not tell you the decision in court. The decision (judgment) will be mailed to you. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h2>If You Are The Defendant</h2>\r\n          <p>If you have been named as a defendant in a Small Claims action and have received an order to appear at a Small Claims hearing, this means that you are being sued. If you don't know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately for an explanation. </p>\r\n          <p>Never ignore an order to appear in court even if you think the case is wrong, unfair, or has no basis. If you do not appear in court at the proper time and date, the court may still hear and decide the case without you and you may lose the suit by default. </p>\r\n          <p>If you believe the plaintiff has caused you injury or owes you money for any reason, you can file a claim against the plaintiff in the same Small Claims court action. If your case is related to the subject of the plaintiff's case, it may be helpful and convenient to resolve it at the same hearing by filing a Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p>If judgment has been entered against you and the appeal time has lapsed, your money or property and maybe a portion of your earnings can then be taken legally by the judgment creditor to pay the judgment against you. A Small Claims judgment is public record. Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, these agencies come to the court often and place the judgment on the losing party's credit record even after the judgment is paid.</p>\r\n          <p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n   \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Small Claims"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/small-claims.shtml"},

The mediator's job is to be impartial, keep things fair, help you look at different options, help you come up with a calendar for times with the children, and support you in your efforts. </p>\r\n          <h2> Mediation Rules</h2>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Each parent is treated with respect and has an equal chance to explain his or her viewpoint and concerns. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent listens to the other and tries to find realistic solutions. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to put the children first and focus on what the children need and can handle.</li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to show respect for the other and to recognize that their child has a right to a relationship with each of them. </li>\r\n            <li>Hitting, pushing, shoving, and threats of any type are not allowed and considered domestic violence.

You may also choose to see the mediator alone and at a different time from the other parent. </p>\r\n          <p>Also, if a mediator suspects any kind of child abuse, he or she is required by law to report it.

{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <h2>Landlord Requirements </h2>\r\n          <h3>Unlawful detainer proceedings</h3>\r\n          <p>When a landlord wants to end a tenancy involuntarily after the tenant has taken possession of the rental premises, the landlord must take certain legal steps to do so. An unlawful detainer proceeding is an accelerated method for recovery of possession of leased premises. It is a limited proceeding designed to permit a landlord to recover possession of real property from a tenant who is wrongfully in possession. (Because of its summary character, an unlawful detainer action is not a suitable vehicle for trying complicated ownership issues involving allegations of fraud.) </p>\r\n          <p> Like civil actions generally, unlawful detainer actions are initiated by the filing of a complaint, issuance of a summons, and service of the complaint and summons on the defendant.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Landlords in California must first follow all requirements for eviction proceedings prescribed in California statutes and follow any applicable local ordinances. </p>\r\n          <h3>Three-day and 30-day notice</h3>\r\n          <p>An unlawful detainer proceeding is usually initiated by the landlord's serving a 3-day or 30-day notice on the tenant. A landlord must strictly comply with the statutory requirements for service of the notice to quit the leased premises. \r\n            \r\n            Among 3-day notices are notices to quit (\"leave\"), notices to perform covenant or quit, and notices to pay rent or quit. Three-day notices to quit are used when a tenant has allegedly breached (\"broken\") a covenant (\"agreement\") in the lease that cannot be cured. A 3-day notice to perform covenant or quit is used when there has been a curable breach other than nonpayment of rent, for example, breach of a covenant not to assign or sublet the premises. The most common notice is a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. </p>\r\n          <p>A landlord\u2019s choice to declare a forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement on a 3-day notice is nullified and the lease or rental agreement remains in effect if the tenant performs within 3 days after service of the notice or if the landlord waives the breach after service of the notice. </p>\r\n          <p>A 30-day notice to quit usually addresses a situation in which the landlord wishes to terminate an indefinite-term tenancy (that is, a holdover tenant or a tenant on a month-to-month tenancy). The landlord and tenant may provide by agreement at the time the tenancy is created that either party may terminate the tenancy on less than 30 days\u2019 notice, but the agreement may not provide for less than 7 days\u2019 notice. </p>\r\n          <p>No notice is required for an unlawful detainer action based on the expiration of a fixed-term tenancy, nor is notice required when a tenant occupies the property as part of his or her employment (for example, as an apartment manager), which has been terminated. </p>\r\n          <h3>Filing a complaint</h3>\r\n          <p>After you have complied with applicable notice requirements, the residential eviction process is begun by filing a complaint with the local court. To file a complaint, you may use Complaint Unlawful Detainer (Form 982.1(90)) and file the form with the local court, paying the applicable filing fee. </p>\r\n          <h3>Obtaining and serving the summons</h3>\r\n          <p>You then obtain a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) from the local court and must serve the summons on the tenant, adhering to appropriate service requirements. </p>\r\n          <h2>Tenant Requirements </h2>\r\n          <p>Responding to the complaint. As a tenant, if you are served with a Summons \u2014 Unlawful Detainer (Form 982(a)(11)) and complaint concerning an eviction, you must respond to the summons. You may use Judicial Council Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer, to respond and must file the answer form with the local court that issued the summons. You must also pay a filing fee when filing the answer form, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. </p>\r\n          <p>Download fee waiver forms and instructions by clicking on the form number below:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a17.pdf\">982(a)(17)</a> Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a18.pdf\">982(a)(18)</a> Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>The following forms are used for later filings in your case: </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a20.pdf\">982(a)(20)</a> Application for Waiver of Additional Court Fees and Costs </li>\r\n            <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov./forms/documents/982a181.pdf\">982(a)(18.1)</a> Court Fees and Costs Order on Application for Waiver of Additional </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are confidential forms for the court. Do not have them served on the other party.</p>\r\n          <p>If there is more than one tenant, or defendant, listed in the complaint, each tenant must respond separately or a default judgment may be entered against the tenants who do not file an answer. Two tenants can share one answer form, but each must sign the answer form individually and pay a separate filing fee. If you are filing the answer for yourself only, put your name on line 1 of the answer form. If you are filing the answer for yourself and another tenant named in the complaint, put both your names on line 1. </p>\r\n          <p>Each tenant named in the complaint has five days after the summons is served to file an answer form at the court that issued the summons. (The five-day response time includes Saturdays and Sundays, but excludes all judicial holidays. If the last day for filing a response is a Saturday or Sunday, the tenant has until close of business on the next court day to file a response.) </p>\r\n          <p>A letter or phone call does not serve as a response. The answer must be on the proper legal form \u2014 Form 982.1(95), Answer \u2014 Unlawful Detainer \u2014 in order for the court to hear the case.</p>\r\n          <p>If an answer is not filed on time, the tenant may lose the case, be evicted, and have his or her wages, money, and property taken by the landlord without further warning from the court. </p>\r\n          <p>The tenant\u2019s time to respond to a complaint for unlawful detainer is not affected by the tenant's quitting of the leased premises.</p>\r\n          <p>Serving the answer and completing a proof of service form: Before you file your answer with the court, you first have to make sure that a copy of the answer is served on the landlord of the property. This means that a copy of the answer along with a proof of service form must be given to the attorney for the landlord or, if the landlord is not represented by an attorney, to the landlord. It can be served by mail or hand delivered, but only by a person who is at least 18 years of age and is not a plaintiff or defendant in the case. </p>\r\n          <p> A Proof of Service form is used to show the court that a copy of your answer was sent to the other party in the case before you filed the original answer. It does not have to be received by the other party before you file; it must only be put in the mail. The Proof of Service must be signed by a person over 18 who is not a party to the case. This means that neither you, nor any other tenant in the case, can sign the Proof of Service form. You can obtain a Proof of Service form from your local superior court or from books containing general legal forms available from legal publishers or bookstores. </p>\r\n          <p> The court will not accept an answer for filing without a signed Proof of Service form attached. </p>\r\n          <p>You may want to call an attorney for assistance. If you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Landlord / Tenant / Unlawful Detainer"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/landlord-tenant.shtml"},

In delinquency cases, the juvenile court can also order children to be confined in locked facilities, including the California Youth Authority. </p>\r\n          <p>Whenever the court decides to remove a child from his or her home, placement and responsibility for that child is given to a governmental agency. It can also order services to be provided that will allow children to remain in their homes safely. In delinquency and status offense cases, that agency is the probation department; in dependency (abuse and neglect) cases, the agency is the county welfare department. The agency is responsible for meeting the health and educational needs of the child, as well as providing the care, treatment, and guidance the child may need.</p>\r\n          <h2>Legal Help </h2>\r\n          <p>Because these decisions are so serious and affect fundamental rights, it is very important that, if a juvenile case involves you or your child, you consult an attorney who can advise you more specifically about the court process as it relates to your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Your Right to an Attorney </h2>\r\n          <p>The child in a delinquency case has a right to an attorney; a parent in a dependency (abuse and neglect) case has a right to an attorney; and the court must appoint an attorney for the child in an abuse and neglect case unless the court finds the child would not benefit from the appointment.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/_dev/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n          <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Juvenile Court"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/divisions/juvenile.shtml"},

It also protects minority opinions or unpopular causes from persecution or prosecution. The grand jury concept has a long history and has adapted throughout the centuries to meet the needs and conditions of each time period. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p> Grand juries perform two primary roles. One is to evaluate the validity of charges being brought by a prosecutor, if the charges are not reviewed by a judge, to ensure that they are not frivolous or ungrounded. The other is to inquire into, and investigate if necessary, the operations of local government agencies and officials to ensure that activities are valid and services are efficiently and legally provided. In both instances, the secrecy of the grand jury's deliberations is a common thread that ensures independent and objective consideration of facts brought before it.</p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   <div class=\"simpleModule\">\r\n\r\n          \r\n            <!--- Begin Accordion --->\r\n             \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2Wrap\">\r\n                                        \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n                        document.write(\"<div class=\\\"controls2\\\"><a class=\\\"expandall\\\" href=\\#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.expandall('trigger2'); return false\\\">expand all<\\/a> <a class=\\\"collapseall\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.collapseall('trigger2'); return false\\\">collapse all<\\/a><\\/div>\");\r\n                        </script>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                \r\n   \r\n     <div class=\"trigger2\">An Invitation to Participate in the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> You can make a difference </h4>\r\n                      <p> Participation in Grand Jury investigation and discussion is a rich and rewarding experience. It is an opportunity to get an intimate look at how government works and to make informed and valuable recommendations regarding possible improvements. It is also an opportunity to serve with fellow county residents and to discover how a body of nineteen citizens reaches consensus. This is the heart of the democratic process, and service on the Grand Jury is a valuable way to learn, to contribute and to make a difference in your community. </p>\r\n                      <h4> Selection Process </h4>\r\n                      <p> Applications for grand jury service are sent to citizens of Glenn County by random selection through the use of voter registration and Department of Motor Vehicles lists. Citizens are also encouraged to volunteer to be considered as a prospective Grand Juror through public announcements through local radio and television stations and press. Every effort is made to recruit both men and women from all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups and age groups.\r\n                        \r\n                        Applications for grand jury service are given an initial review by Court Administration to ensure that each applicant meets the qualifications to be a grand juror as outlined in this pamphlet. After the initial review, qualified applicants are scheduled for an interview with the Grand Jury Selection Committee. The Selection Committee is comprised of the Court\u2019s Judges, Executive Officer, and the incoming and outgoing Grand Jury forepersons.\r\n                        \r\n                        After the interviews, qualified prospective Grand Jurors are summoned to appear in court where all names are placed in a lottery draw. The first 19 names chosen become the next Glenn County Grand Jury. The remaining names are drawn to provide alternates.\r\n                        \r\n                        Shortly before the beginning of the term of service, July 1 through June 30, a training program is conducted for incoming Grand Jurors pursuant to PC \u00a7914(b). The foreperson is selected by the Presiding Judge.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h4>Commitment/Compensation </h4>\r\n                      <p>The complex, diverse responsibilities of grand jurors make it necessary to give a serious commitment to the time requirements. The usual work schedule is one to two evenings per month, although some day or weekend meetings may be required. However, each grand jury sets the dates and times of their meetings that is most convenient for all members. Jurors are provided with meeting facilities and parking, as well as a stipend. Reimbursement for the mileage to and from meetings is allowed at the regular county rate. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Application and Contact Information </h4>\r\n                      <p>For more information or a grand jury application, please write, email, or call:<br>\r\n                        \r\n                        Superior Court of California,                     County of Glenn<br>\r\n                        Office of the Jury Commissioner<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988<br>\r\n                        (530) 934-6382<br>\r\n                        <a href=\"mailto:askus@glenncourts.com\">askus@glenncourts.com</a></p>\r\n                      <p> <a href=\"documents/Juror%20Questionnaire%20Website.pdf\">Download the pdf version of the questionnaire here</a> If you are interested in participating in the Grand Jury process, please send a completed questionnaire to: </p>\r\n                      <p>Court Administrative Assistant<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">History of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> Before American Development </h4>\r\n                      <p> Some historians believe that the earliest versions of the grand jury existed in Athens, where the Greeks used citizen groups to develop accusations. Others find traces of the concept in all the Teutonic peoples, including early Anglo-Saxons. For example, the concept was employed in the early Scandinavian countries. Evidence also exists that the early French developed the \"King's Audit\" involving citizens who were sworn and required to provide fiscal information related to the operation of the kingdom.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>However, most commentators believe that the grand jury arose as an institution in England. In the first millennium, English individuals prosecuted criminals, with the king personally involved in the system. Under the Doom Law of Anglo-Saxon King Aethelred (980-1016), a dozen landowners were appointed to investigate alleged crimes. In 1166, King Henry II established a system of local informers (twelve men from every one hundred) to identify those who were \"suspected of\" various crimes. If the suspects survived their \"trials by ordeal\", they paid fines to the King. However, the \"informers\" were fined if they failed to indict any suspect, or even enough suspects. After 1188, they became tax collectors as well, and after the reign of Henry III, they were charged with looking into the condition and maintenance of public works. </p>\r\n                      <p> The Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215, did not mention the grand jury specifically, but did establish various procedures to ensure fairness in the dispensation of justice. Thereafter, until the mid-1300's, the 12-man juries served both to present indictments and also to rule on the validity of charges. During Edward III's reign, from 1312-1377, the 12 individuals were replaced by 24 knights, called \"le grande inquest\", and the 12 became a \"petit jury\" responsible only for declaring innocent or guilty verdicts. </p>\r\n                      <p> Ultimately, in the 1600's, the English grand jury developed as a process to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that an accused individual was guilty of a crime. Grand juries reached their English pinnacle of citizen protectors in 1681, when they refused to indict enemies of King Charles II for alleged crimes. (Ironically, English laws establishing grand juries were repealed in 1933.)</p>\r\n                      <h4>Early American Development</h4>\r\n                      <p>The use of juries in earliest colonial history was limited. In the New Haven colony, for example, religious beliefs resulted in the residents eliminating trial by jury because there was no reference to juries in the laws of Moses. However, procedures similar to grand juries were used to hear criminal charges of larceny (Boston, 1644), holding a disorderly meeting (Plymouth, 1651), and witchcraft (Pennsylvania, 1683). In the early 1600's, colonial representatives of the English monarchs made laws and prosecuted violators. The first grand juries recommended civil charges against those crown agents, thus establishing themselves as representatives of the governed, similar to grand juries today. The first grand juries also looked into government misconduct or neglect. For example, the first colonial grand jury, established in Massachusetts in 1635, \"presented\" town officials for neglecting to repair stocks, as well as considering cases of murder, robbery and spousal abuse. </p>\r\n                      <p>Other early grand juries performed a variety of administrative functions, including audits of county funds (New Jersey), inspections of public buildings (Carolinas), and review of taxes and public works (Virginia). Virginia grand juries also investigated whether each family planted two acres of corn per person.</p>\r\n                      <p>In the Colonies, grand juries were considering criminal accusations and investigating government officials and activities, but with a populist view. Grand jurors included popular leaders such as Paul Revere and John Hancock's brother. These grand juries played a critical role in the pre-Revolutionary period: for example, three grand juries refused to indict John Peter Zenger, whose newspaper criticized the royal governor's actions in New York (he ultimately was prosecuted by the provincial attorney, defended by Alexander Hamilton, and acquitted). Grand juries also denounced arbitrary royal intrusions on citizens' rights, refused to indict the leaders against the Stamp Act of 1765, and refused to bring libel charges against the editors of the Boston Gazette in 1766. </p>\r\n                      <p>After the Revolutionary War ended, the new federal constitution did not include a grand jury. Early American leaders such as John Hancock and James Madison objected. Thereafter, the grand jury was included in the Bill of Rights, as part of the Fifth Amendment, which states, \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger...\" </p>\r\n                      <p>From then, until today, the federal grand jury remains an integral part of the justice system, used by federal prosecutors for a variety of potential crimes. In 1801, a federal grand jury indicted Colonel Aaron Burr for treason. Most recently, federal grand juries considered allegations related to the Oklahoma City and New York Trade Center bombings, President Clinton's conduct both before and during his term of office, and the recent claims of wrong-doing by former California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and some associates. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Adaptation by the States </h4>\r\n                      <p>As the various states were admitted to the Union and adopted their legal and operating procedures, almost every one initially included some reliance on grand juries for either (or both) review of criminal indictments or inquiries into government activities. Some states' grand juries were very active in administrative affairs, even including recommending new laws. Others carried out investigations of government officials; one Tennessee grand jury indicted the entire state court of appeals and another opposed a judge's reappointment on the grounds of \"mental imbecility\". </p>\r\n                      <p>Throughout this state-by-state development, the underlying concept remained the same: ordinary citizens, neighbors, and others on grand juries were a necessary part of government to ensure that public prosecutors were not swayed by personal or political prejudices, and that government officials efficiently and effectively performed their jobs. </p>\r\n                      <p>Since the mid-1800's, grand juries have been criticized as ineffective or out-of-date by a number of reformers because they were slow, lacked expertise, and on other grounds. Others criticized the \"star chamber\" atmosphere of secret hearings without customary due process rights. However, these complaints were offset by effective grand jury investigations, including those of the Boss Tweed ring in New York City (1871) and racketeering charges brought by a grand jury assisted by Thomas Dewey in the 1930's. Since the nineteenth century, various minor and major changes have been made in grand jury selection, procedures, and qualifications, often resulting in fairer and more efficient jury operations. </p>\r\n                      <p>Today, all states except Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, may use grand juries to indict and begin criminal trials. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia require that grand jury indictments be used for certain-more serious-crimes. California and twenty-four other states make use of grand jury indictments optional. All states and the District of Columbia use grand juries for investigative purposes. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">The Grand Jury's Role</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Prosecutions </h4>\r\n                      <p>Although the American grand jury originally was conceived as a protector of ordinary citizens by other ordinary citizens, the fairness of its criminal operations has been questioned by various commentators and judges. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas stated, \"It is, indeed, common knowledge that the Grand Jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the Government, is now a tool of the Executive.\" Some even have referred to it as a \"rubber stamp\" for prosecutors. In the criminal system, the California constitution and laws provide that felony prosecutions are initiated only after a determination that there is \"probable cause\" to believe that specific individuals committed specific crimes. This is done either by \"information\" presented for examination and approval by a judge, or by indictment after a grand jury hearing and vote. In either case, the purpose of the objective review is to prevent overzealous prosecutors from unjustified, groundless, or unfair prosecutions when \"probable cause\" does not exist. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury operates without providing many fundamental rights common in court hearings and trials. For example, the defendant has neither the right to present evidence to the grand jury or cross-examine the witnesses against him or her. Only the prosecutor may present evidence, and the defendant has no right to counsel, even if required to testify. Even judges generally are excluded, leaving the grand jurors to rely on the prosecutor for all information. One early study indicated that 95% of all cases brought to the grand jury resulted in indictments, raising questions about the value of this review because the grand jury is not able to adequately evaluate the evidence presented only by the district attorney. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The role of the grand jury in civil investigations presents an interesting twist: the original (English) grand juries served to aid the government in finding and prosecuting private citizens' misdeeds; now, these juries investigate and accuse public figures, defending individual citizens' rights and expectations. Grand juries, both federal and state, may investigate criminal activity or non-criminal activities. In California, for example, the grand jury can investigate any activity by a public official (other than court), which violates a state law, and many other activities, as long as they occur within the county of the grand jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>State grand juries, but not federal grand juries, can investigate any non-criminal activity and report and make recommendations based on the results of the investigation. These investigations commonly include reviewing the operation and condition of jails and prisons, investigating the conduct of local public officials, and other similar matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The results of these investigations may be criminal charges, recommendations for new laws, or merely reports to the public identifying problems but proposing no specific solutions.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Duties of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <h4>\r\n                            \r\n                      Government Watchdog</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In California today, provisions of the Penal Code to require the grand jury:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Investigate and report on the accounts, records, operations, and functions of district, city and county government and public officials (Penal Code \u00a7 925 &amp; 925a); it may also inquire into the affairs of joint powers agencies located in the county. </li>\r\n  <li>Inquire into the condition and management of all correctional facilities within the county (Penal Code \u00a7 919(b)). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The grand jury may investigate or inquire into county matters of civil concern, such as the needs of county officers, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of the several offices. </p>\r\n<h4>Powers permitted to the grand jury include:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Free access, at reasonable times, to public prisons; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine all public records within the county;</li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine books and records of <ul>\r\n  <li>any incorporated city, or joint powers agency located in the county; </li>\r\n  <li>certain redevelopment agencies and housing authorities; </li>\r\n  <li>special-purpose assessing or taxing districts wholly or partly within the county; &amp; </li>\r\n  <li>non-profit corporations established by or operated on behalf of a public entity; </li></ul></li>\r\n  <li>The authority to investigate and report on operations and methods of performing duties of any such city, county, or joint powers agency and to make recommendations as deemed proper; </li>\r\n  <li>The ability, with permission of the Superior Court, to hire experts such as auditors and accountants; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to inquire into the sale, transfer and ownership of lands which might or should escheat to the state. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Note:\t</strong>The grand jury has no authority to investigate the courts or the acts or commissions of any judge or judicial employee.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Criminal Indictments</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Constitution permits criminal trial on the basis of indictment by a grand jury or by information after the district attorney recommends prosecution and a judge agrees that facts exist which warrant prosecution. In addition, under \u00a7 917 of the Penal Code, \"the grand jury may inquire into all public offenses committed or triable within the county, and present them to the court by indictment.\" In actual practice, grand juries seldom initiate such inquiries; rather, such offenses are generally brought to the grand jury by the district attorney, who asks for and generally receives an indictment, upon presentation of adequate facts.\r\n\r\n</p><p>According to the California Grand Jurors Association, the district attorney much more frequently bypasses the grand jury and uses the process known as a preliminary hearing. A 1954 survey of California district attorneys listed the following factors as influential in the decision to seek a grand jury indictment rather than using the preliminary hearing: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>High public interest in the case; </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that a preliminary hearing would take more time than a grand jury hearing; </li>\r\n  <li>The necessity for calling children or witnesses who would be subject to cross-examination at a preliminary hearing;</li>\r\n  <li>The existence of a weak or doubtful case which the district attorney wishes to test; </li>\r\n  <li>Cases involving malfeasance in office; and </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that witnesses are in a state prison. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A more recent study adds the following reasons for using the grand jury: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Cases where the defendant cannot be located and the time limit under the statute of limitations is about to expire, </li>\r\n  <li>Where the secrecy of the grand jury may allow defendants to be charged and taken into custody before they can pose potential danger to a witness's safety or flee from the jurisdiction, </li>\r\n  <li>The need to protect the identity of undercover agents, </li>\r\n  <li>And the ability to test a witness before a jury. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>From 1978 until 1990, grand juries were seldom used for indictments. A California Supreme Court ruling required holding preliminary hearings even if grand jury indictments were obtained. In 1990, a constitutional amendment made significant alterations in California criminal law and court procedures, including a provision that defendants were not entitled to preliminary hearings if indicted by a grand jury. As noted above, recent statutes (Penal Code \u00a7 904.6) give district attorneys the option of using special grand juries chosen from the regular jury pool to handle criminal cases and thus ensure indictment by those who represent a cross section of the community. Although the law allows criminal indictments to be brought by a grand jury, in practice, the District Attorney generally prefers to use the speedier preliminary hearing process.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">California Grand Juries</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> An Overview </h4>\r\n                      <p>Grand Juries are impaneled in every county in California. Article I, \u00a723 of the California Constitution states: \"a grand jury shall be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each county.\" Depending on a county's population, a specified number of citizens ranging from 11 to 23 in each of California's 58 counties are empowered to investigate and report on various activities of county and city government. The rules governing the makeup, organization, powers and duties of grand juries in California are found in the California Penal Code \u00a7888-939. Recent changes in the Penal Code (\u00a7904.6, 1991) permit any county to have an additional grand jury at the discretion of the presiding judge of the superior court. </p>\r\n                      <p>The statutes permit some variation in the manner and time of selection of jurors and require only that the term of service be for one year and coincide with the County's fiscal year. Qualifications for grand jurors are outlined in Penal Code \u00a7 893. This section requires the prospective grand juror be at least 18 years old, in possession of their natural faculties and have sufficient knowledge of the English language. In Sacramento County, each grand jury begins its term July 1 and ends its service June 30 of the following year. Throughout the State, prospective grand jurors in each county are chosen through a lengthy process that includes application, screening by the jury commissioner from Department of Motor Vehicle Records, voter rolls, and nomination of interested persons by Superior Court Judges. A thorough background check is made on all interested persons and list of qualified candidates is submitted to the judges for review and approval. Since some members of the existing grand jury may be carried over for a second term, the number of names drawn will equal those needed to provide a grand jury of 19 members. (The law allows for a grand jury of 23 in counties with greater than four million population and for 11 members in counties with less than 20,000 population. (Penal Code \u00a7888.2)) It has been the practice in many counties to advertise widely and to encourage many people to apply for the grand jury. Because grand jury service requires the devotion and commitment for only a token payment, it is desirable for grand jurors to have an interest in community affairs and be open-minded with a true concern for the views of others. Grand jurors also should posses some investigative skills and be able to take good notes and write and type reports. A good knowledge of the functions and responsibilities of city and county government is also helpful. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Investigation of Complaints and Accusations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury also is likely to receive a number of citizen complaints, many of which involve operations of county or city agencies or special districts. Whether the complaint is civil or criminal, rules of secrecy apply, and during the course of its investigation, the grand jury may not divulge the subject or methods of inquiry. The subject of the investigation and the methods of inquiry are only revealed when the final report is published. Privileged or confidential material is not included in the grand jury reports. Thus the names of those questioned and facts that might lead to the identity of a person who provided information to the grand jury are not released. \u00a7 919(c) of the Penal Code requires the grand jury to inquire into the willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Where misconduct is found, the grand jury may file an accusation leading to a trial. If the official is convicted, the person is thereby removed from office. Very few of these accusations are filed. Frequently, if there is misconduct in office, it is of a criminal nature, and an indictment rather than an accusation would be issued. It is also possible that an official would resign rather than face an accusation. The grand jury may file an accusatory pleading against a corporation doing business in its county of jurisdiction (Penal Code \u00a7 892). In a report published by the California Grand Jurors Association, misconduct in office could include any of the following: </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Nonfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The failure to act where duty requires an act; or</li>\r\n                        <li>Neglect or refusal, without sufficient cause or excuse, to do that which is the officer's legal duty to do, whether willfully or through malice; or </li>\r\n                        <li>Willful neglect of duty. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Misfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The improper or doing of an act that a person might lawfully do; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a duty or act that one ought to do or has a right to do, but in manner such as to infringe upon the rights of others. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Malfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The performance of an act that is positively unlawful or wrong; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a wrongful act that the person has no legal right to do. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Reports</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> State Law requires that each grand jury submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the presiding judge of the Superior Court. </p>\r\n                      <p>A report, just as an accusation or an indictment, must be approved by at least 12 of the 19 grand jurors (15 if it is a 23 member jury). With so many possible investigations and a term limited to a single year, it is necessary for each grand jury to make hard decisions as to what it wishes to undertake during the term. Except for mandated duties to report on the financial condition of the county and on the conditions of county jails, the grand jury discretion in determining its agenda. Most grand juries divide into committees for conducting investigations and for writing reports, but there seems to be a wide variation between counties as to the number and structure of committees; it is up to each grand jury to determine its own method of operation within the parameters of the law. </p>\r\n                      <p>Government agencies that are the subject of reports are required by law to respond to specific grand jury findings and recommendations. However, the grand jury has no enforcement power, and the agencies are under no legal obligation to carry out the recommendations. While some recommendations are ignored, others are followed; particularly those that suggest greater efficiency for operations and that do not require the expenditure of large sums of money. Grand jury criticisms of public officials and agencies frequently attract press attention, bringing greater community awareness of what is happening in public agencies. Many grand jurors believe that public officials tend to be more accountable when they know an impartial; outside body is looking over their collective shoulders. </p>\r\n                      <p>The California Grand Jurors Association (CGJA) (www.cgja.org), a statewide organization of former grand jurors has begun a program of identifying and indexing grand jury reports in each county with the hope of establishing a state archive of annual reports. The State Library also maintains an archive of grand jury reports from all counties. CGJA also monitors and occasionally proposes or endorses proposed laws to conserve and improve the grand jury as an important institution of local government. It offers services to those grand juries that may request advice and help in preparing informational manuals and in providing orientation for incoming jurors. Some members of the CGJA now provide orientation programs for those counties that request this service. </p>\r\n                      <p>While surrounded by secrecy before publication, grand jury reports become public documents when signed by the grand jury foreman and approved by the grand jury's advisory judge. Copies are sent: to all targeted government agencies, to interested officials, to public and private groups and individuals and to the press. At the end of the year, bound or loose-leaf copies of all reports are placed in all public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Online Grand Jury Reports</h4>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2016-2017_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2016 - 2017 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2015-2016_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2015 - 2016 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2014-2015_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2014 - 2015 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2013-2014_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2013 - 2014 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2012-2013_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2012 - 2013 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2011-2012_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2011 - 2012 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2010-2011_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2010 - 2011 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2009-2010_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2009 - 2010 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2007-2008_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2007 - 2008 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2006-2007_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2006 - 2007 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2005-2006_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2005 - 2006 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2004-2005_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2004 - 2005 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2003-2004_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2003 - 2004 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2002-2003_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2002 - 2003 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Report-Revised_Response_02-23.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report-Revised</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2000-2001_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2000 - 2001 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Criminal/Civil Functions</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The major functions of a grand jury are divided into criminal indictments and civil investigations. While the same panel in Glenn County executes both functions, the civil investigation portion requires the majority of the jury\u2019s time. California Penal Code section 904.0(a) allows the presiding judge of Superior Court to impanel one additional grand jury. The additional grand jury would have sole jurisdiction to return criminal indictments.</p>\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Indictments </h4>\r\n                      <p>The District Attorney will bring the majority of cases that are presented to the grand jury; however, the State Attorney General or a Special Prosecutor may present a case. The responsibility of the grand jury does not extend beyond the determination of whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has committed such crime.\r\n                        \r\n                        Criminal indictment hearings are conducted in secrecy to protect witnesses and defendants in cases of no indictment. During a criminal investigation only District Attorney representatives and a court reporter are allowed in the jury room, with a few exceptions. No person other than a grand juror may be present during deliberations or voting. An indictment can be returned only if a minimum of 12 jurors agrees. </p>\r\n                      <p>Historically, the grand jury indictment process is used for cases where: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Public officials, employees, or police officers are involved </li>\r\n                        <li>Statute of limitations is a concern</li>\r\n                        <li>The indictment is complex and must be presented over a long period of time </li>\r\n                        <li>Grand jury subpoena powers are necessary </li>\r\n                        <li>Secrecy and non-adversary nature for sensitive cases are needed, such as cases involving children or rape victims </li>\r\n                        <li>Criminal indictments are extremely rare in Glenn County. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The civil, or \u201cwatchdog\u201d, responsibilities of the grand jury encompass the examination of all aspects of county government, including special districts, to ensure that the county is being governed honestly and efficiently and that county monies are being handled appropriately. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury is mandated by law to inquire into the conditions and management of public jails.\r\n                        \r\n                        The grand jury may conduct investigations on public agencies and on the administration and affairs of any city within the county, as well as examine books and records of redevelopment agencies. It is also appropriate for any private citizen, county official or county employee to present a written complaint to the grand jury for investigation. </p>\r\n                      <p>During its term, the grand jury selects the government affairs it wishes to investigate. These investigations are generally conducted by committees, which correspond with the primary functions of the county. Committees may ask for support and advice from the Superior Court Presiding Judge, District Attorney, County Counsel, Attorney General, or outside consultants. </p>\r\n                      <p>On the last day of each year of service, the grand jury is required by law to submit all final reports to the Presiding Judge. These reports include all studies and investigations conducted by the grand jury during its term, with appropriate recommendations.

It frequently happens that a prospective juror will be excused in a certain case and later accepted in another. The number of peremptory challenges have been established by the Legislature.</td>\r\n   \t\t                  </tr>\r\n   \t\t                </tbody>\r\n   \t\t              </table>\r\n   \t\t            </blockquote>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Civil case/civil suit:</strong>\u00a0A lawsuit is called a civil case when it is between two or more individuals or corporations involved in a dispute and usually seeking a judgment awarding monetary damages. A civil case is an action brought to enforce, redress, or protect private rights. Civil actions include:</p>\r\n      \t\t        <ul>\r\n      \t\t          <li>General Civil (seeking damages over $25,000)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Limited Civil (seeking damages under $25,000)\u00a0Family Law</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Probate</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Unlawful Detainer (landlord/tenant disputes)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Small Claims (seeking damages under $5,000)</li>\r\n   \t\t            </ul>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Common law:\u00a0</strong>The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from constitutions or statutes.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Compulsory:</strong>\u00a0Compelled; mandated by legal process or by statute.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Constitution:</strong>\u00a0The fundamental law of our nation. It establishes the character and organization of America's sovereign power and the manner of its exercise. Also, the document that contains the guiding rules and principles, the descriptions of the power of the federal government, and the essential rights of the people.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Controversy:</strong>\u00a0A disagreement or a dispute that requires a definitive determination of how the law applies to the facts that are asserted to be true.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Counsel:</strong>\u00a0One or more lawyers who represent a client.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p>Criminal prosecution/criminal case: The act of pursuing a criminal trial, where the state charges someone with a crime. A criminal case is an action brought by the government against a person who has broken the law. Criminal cases are separated into three main categories; felony, misdemeanors, and infractions</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Degree of proof:</strong>\u00a0The amount of proof necessary to prove a case. In a criminal case, such proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Deliberations:</strong>\u00a0This occurs after a trial when a jury goes into its assigned private room to think about and discuss evidence and testimony to help it reach a verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Directed verdict:</strong>\u00a0After evidence has been presented and if no issue of fact remains for the jury to determine, the judge will tell the jury what verdict to return. The jury must return that verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Disqualification (juror)</strong>: The condition of having been rendered not qualified to serve.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Eligible/eligibility ( for jury duty):</strong>\u00a0Every person who is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the respective county, able to understand the English language, not currently serving on any other jury, and who has not been convicted of a felony is eligible to serve as a juror (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 203).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong>\u00a0Any type of legal proof presented at trial through witnesses, records, and/or exhibits.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exemptions/excuses/postponements (for jury service):</strong>\u00a0By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong>\u00a0Document or material object produced and identified in court as evidence in a case. Each of these documents or objects is ordinarily given an identifying letter or number in alphabetical or numerical sequence when it is offered as evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Felon:</strong>\u00a0A person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Foreperson:</strong>\u00a0Often called the \"presiding juror.\" At the beginning of deliberations, the jury votes to select one of its members to be the foreperson. The jury foreperson's duty is to preside and see that discussion during deliberations is carried on in a free and orderly manner, that the case and issues are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given a chance to participate in the discussion. As the deliberations conclude, the foreperson counts the votes and completes and signs the verdict form.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Impartial:</strong>\u00a0Without bias, prejudice, or other preconception. The members of a jury should have no opinion about or vested interest in a case at the start of the trial and should base their verdict only on competent legal evidence presented during the trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong>\u00a0The guidelines given by the judge at the beginning and end of a trial that explain what the law in the case is and how the jurors should evaluate the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury pool:</strong>\u00a0The group of prospective qualified jurors appearing for assignment to trial jury panels.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury summons:</strong>\u00a0The papers sent to potential jurors that require their attendance in court for possible service on a jury. California courts summon jurors to the courthouse no more than once in any given 12-month period.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury selection:</strong>\u00a0The process by which jurors for a particular trial are selected from the larger group of potential jurors summoned to the courthouse. Once the jurors arrive in the courtroom, the judge and lawyers ask the jurors questions for the purpose of determining whether jurors are free of bias, or prejudice, or anything might interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Juvenile Case:</strong>\u00a0Juvenile cases are those involving minors under the age of 18 years. These are separated into two main categories--Juvenile Delinquency for minors who have broken the law and Juvenile Dependency for minors who have been removed from the home and/or care of their parents or guardians.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Litigants:</strong>\u00a0Any persons or groups engaged in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>One-day/one-trial:</strong>\u00a0California courts have adopted the one-day or one-trial system. One day or one trial means that prospective jurors have to come to the court only once. If you are not chosen for a trial, then your term of service is complete for one year. If you do serve on a jury, you will not be required to report for jury service for at least another 12 months.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Pending:</strong>\u00a0In process; not yet decided.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Perjury:</strong>\u00a0A false statement made willfully and knowingly while under oath in a court proceeding.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Polled/polling:</strong>\u00a0Calling the names of the jurors and having them state what their final verdict is before it is recorded.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postpone:</strong>\u00a0To put off until later.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postponement:</strong>\u00a0Permission to put off serving as a juror until a later time. A postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called for jury service. See also exemptions/excuses.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Preponderance of the evidence:</strong>\u00a0Greater weight of evidence, or evidence that is more credible and convincing. Refers to the amount of proof required to win in a civil case. It is that degree of proof that is more probable than not (lower standard than that required in criminal cases).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Propound:</strong>\u00a0To offer for discussion or consideration.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prosecutions:</strong>\u00a0Criminal legal proceedings.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prospective:</strong>\u00a0Likely to come about, relating to or effective in the future.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Reimbursement:</strong>\u00a0Specific payment for out-of-pocket expenses. For example, the court pays jurors mileage, based on the IRS standards, (one way) for travel.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Sequestration:</strong>\u00a0A sequestered jury is usually housed together at night in a hotel and prohibited from contacting people outside of the court. Sequestration rarely occurs and is meant for jurors' protection. It may be used to keep jurors away from the media during a controversial trial where widespread news coverage could influence a juror's decision. In rare cases, there may be attempts to influence the jurors' deliberation.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Source list:</strong>\u00a0The list or lists from which citizens are selected to receive a jury summons in California. Potential jurors are selected randomly from the voter registration list and the Department of Motor Vehicles' lists of drivers.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Subpoena:</strong>\u00a0A subpoena is an official order to attend court at a stated time. The most common use of the subpoena is to summon witnesses to court for the purpose of testifying in a trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Testimony:</strong>\u00a0Evidence given by a witness under oath.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Traffic Case:</strong>\u00a0Traffic cases are those in which citations have been issued for a violation of traffic laws.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unable to serve</strong>: If you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called, a postponement may be available. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unanimous:</strong>\u00a0There are 12 people on a jury trial, except when the parties in civil or misdemeanor cases agree that there may be fewer than 12. A decision is unanimous when the full jury in a criminal case or three-quarters of the jury in a civil case have agreed upon the verdict. Once a verdict has been reached, the jury is brought back into the courtroom. The verdict must be in writing, signed by the foreperson, and must be read to the jury by the court clerk or the judge.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong>\u00a0The formal decision or finding made by a jury, which has been impaneled and sworn for the trial of a case, and reported to the court.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Voir dire:</strong>\u00a0Translated from French, the legal phrase means \"to speak the truth\" or \"to see them say.\" Voir dire is the preliminary examination of prospective jurors by a judge or lawyer to decide whether that person can serve on a particular jury.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Witness:</strong>\u00a0One who can give a firsthand account of something seen, heard, or experienced.</p>\r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Glossary of Terms & Legal Dictionary"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/self-help/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/_dev/self-help/glossary.shtml"},

Within that environment, one of the most significant relationships is that between the judges and the CEO. Judges ultimately are responsible for effective administration of the court. Frequently, constitutions and statutes make this duty clear; other times, the duty is implied. In either case, effective administration takes place when the judiciary and the CEO manage the court together. Effective systems of administration provide for the participation of all judges in the development of policy and planning for the court. Through the collaborative efforts of the CEO and the presiding judge, court policy is implemented, monitored, and facilitated.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO serves the dual function of increasing the amount of time a judge has for adjudication and bringing professional management knowledge and capability to the judiciary. In courts where judges lack administrative support they must divide their time between judicial and administrative functions. With mounting caseloads and increased pressure for more case dispositions, judges have little time to direct the day-to-day operations of the court system, plan for the implementation of new technologies, or integrate new procedures that can improve system performance. A court administrator can help the court develop and recommend policies and coordinated work processes that enhance system performance, while maintaining the independence of individual judges. CEOs can also help develop goals for the courts, prepare and execute budgets, recognize changes in caseload or demographics that will affect court operations and funding, manage court personnel and programs for their professional development, improve jury systems and services to the public, implement automated information systems, plan for space requirements, administrate systems for assessing and collecting fees, and establish procedures for handling information requests.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Court Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>Personal and Professional Skill</p>\r\n                          <p>A Court Executive Officer (CEO) is selected by a process that includes a majority vote of all the judges in a multi-judge court. In very large urban courts, a selection committee chaired by the presiding judge and representative of the entire bench can select the CEO. The position of Court Executive Officer is the most important non-judicial position in the court; therefore, each judge participates in the hiring process.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO\u2019s needs to posses an ability to analyze problems, formulate recommendations, build consensus, empower people, and foster change are among the attributes of a successful administrator. A successful CEO working in a complex court environment exhibits the following:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Learning Skills: Learning to learn is basic to all other skills; court administrators are required to respond quickly, adapt to changes in technologies and workload, and enable the development of appropriate responses to organizational changes.</li>\r\n                            <li>Communication: Speaking, Writing, and Listening Skills: Most of our daily routine is taken up with communication in one form or another. As work processes and procedures are negotiated, monitored, and changed, the ability to communicate clearly is fundamental to success.</li>\r\n                            <li>Adaptability: Problem Solving and Creativity Skills: In any rapidly changing environment, successful CEOs create opportunity and exploit new technologies or create new organizational relationships to overcome barriers to court system goals.</li>\r\n                            <li>Motivation and Goal-setting Skills: The ability to link court system goals and performance measures with work processes and employee reward and staff development programs.</li>\r\n                            <li>Interpersonal Skills: The ability to relate to individuals, both within and outside the court system, through appropriate styles that communicate trust, understanding, and loyalty to court system values.</li>\r\n                            <li>Negotiation Skills: The ability to overcome conflict through problem solving and collaboration strategies that focuses on organizational goals and values as arbiters of conflict and choice.</li>\r\n                            <li>Teamwork Skills: The ability and confidence to empower court system employees and inter-organizational staff to take responsibility for court system goals and performance standards.</li>\r\n                            <li>Leadership Skills: The ability to clearly communicate organizational values that influence others to take individual responsibility for achieving court system values and goals and to instill the confidence to change and adapt as changes in work load, funding, or technology reshape existing work processes or relationships.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p>Ideally, the CEO will combine the technical skills of a manager with knowledge of public and business administration and an understanding of the duties and the problems peculiar to the courts.</p>\r\n                          <p>Specifically, the CEO should have completed considerable study of public and business administration or have on-the-job experience in these fields. To this end, many courts require that a court administrator hold a degree in business, public, or judicial administration or be a graduate of the Court Executive Development Program of the Institute for Court Management. In addition, the court administrator should be familiar with courts and government as well as with business organization and operations.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>Professional Standards</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>The Court Executive Officer should have these qualifications:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Administrative ability demonstrated by substantial experience in progressively more responsible management positions in government or the private sector;</li>\r\n                            <li>Experience in current business and management techniques, including use and implementation of automated data processing;</li>\r\n                            <li>A demonstrated ability to plan and conduct studies to improve court administration and to prepare recommendations and implement them when approved;</li>\r\n                            <li>Good judgment, understanding, and tact ability to maintain working relationships with other courts and with local, state, and federal government officials, members of the bar, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>The ability to conduct conferences and meetings and communicate clearly in writing and speech to employees, the judges of the courts, representatives of government agencies, industry, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>Formal training in court administration and managerial experience, in addition to familiarity with court procedures;</li>\r\n                            <li>Creativity, leadership, planning ability, organizational skills, initiative, decisiveness, and dedication to making productive changes in operating methods;</li>\r\n                            <li>High ethical standards;</li>\r\n                            <li>A fundamental understanding of and loyalty to the court's purpose and goals as a separate branch of government;</li>\r\n                            <li>Knowledge of and ability to adapt to the unique court environment;</li>\r\n                            <li>Ability to follow as well as to lead in the implementation of policies created by the judiciary;</li>\r\n                            <li>Respect for the requirements of confidentiality and loyalty when entrusted with the confidence of the judges;</li>\r\n                            <li>Educational qualifications related directly to the functions that the CEO's position requires.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A graduate degree in judicial administration, public administration, business administration, or law with management training or experience in a court for three or more years with proven competency in administration and management.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A bachelor's degree in one of the fields named above or three years of experience in a responsible elected or appointed position, with training in court administration.                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Court Reporter</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n\r\n                                  What Does a Court Reporter Do?\r\n                                  <p>A court reporter, officially known as a certified shorthand reporter, must record everything that is said during official court proceedings.

It is the job of the judge in that courtroom to be in charge of everything that happens to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In every case, the judge must be impartial. That means the judge must be able to be fair to everyone involved in the case. They are called the parties. If the judge thinks there is any reason for the parties to question whether the judge can be fair, the judge must tell the parties about this reason. If there is any reason that the judge might not be able to be impartial, such as the judge is a friend of one of the parties, the judge must withdraw from the case. That is called a recusal.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a criminal case, the judge schedules an arraignment, at which time the charges that have been filed are explained to the defendant. The defendant may admit to the charges and plead guilty, or the defendant may ask for a trial. There might be a settlement of the case with a plea agreement, also called a plea bargain, in which the prosecutor recommends that the judge impose a sentence that is less than the maximum possible sentence in exchange for the defendant's plea of guilty to the charges; or the defendant might agree to plead guilty to a less serious charge. If case is not settled, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a civil case, the judge will usually meet with the lawyers to see if the case can be resolved or settled without having a trial. In a civil case, the settlement usually involves the payment of money in exchange for voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. If the civil case cannot be settled between the parties, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A party may request that the judge make legal rulings about the case before the trial by filing a motion. To make any rulings on a case, the judge must understand the facts and know the laws that apply to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A trial is the time when the parties present evidence to prove their case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must present the evidence to prove the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. In a civil case, the person who filed the case must present the evidence to prove the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>If a trial is held, the judge is responsible for:</p>\r\n                                  <ul>\r\n                                    <li>Setting the hours of the trial;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Keeping order in the courtroom;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Presiding over the selection of jurors;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Permitting the presentation of evidence through testimony of witnesses or the introduction of exhibits;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Deciding on what evidence can be considered by the jurors in making their decision;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Explaining the law that applies to the case to the jurors so they can deliberate, and</li>\r\n                                    <li>Sentencing the defendant if the defendant is found guilty in a criminal case.</li>\r\n                                  </ul>\r\n                                  <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Judge?</strong></p>\r\n                                  <p>There are two ways to become a judge in California.

The Governor's staff reviews the application. Most successful candidates also submit letters of support from friends, including other lawyers, judges, law school professors, and others who know about the candidate\u2019s qualifications.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the Governor\u2019s office thinks the applicant has sufficient merit, the State Bar of California Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation is asked to review the candidate's application. The commission solicits additional information and recommendations from other lawyers and judges who know the applicant.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the applicant receives a high rating, the Governor\u2019s staff will submit the application to the Governor, who then decides whether to grant the appointment.</li>\r\n                                    <li>A lawyer may also seek a judicial appointment by running for election.

In a courtroom, however, the lawyer\u2019s role is narrowed to a more specific purpose.</p>\r\n                          <p>Generally, there are two sides in a courtroom proceeding. One side, called the plaintiff, who is seeking a remedy for an injury or to a violation of rights. The plaintiff is also called the complainant.

The defendant is also called the respondent.</p>\r\n                          <p>A plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, who is also called an attorney, works for the plaintiff and explains to a judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened. The attorney for the plaintiff wants the judge to find that what happened was not legal and that something should be done to fix it.</p>\r\n                          <p>A defendant\u2019s attorney, who works for the defendant, also explains to the judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened.

The functions of the office are defined by the county charter and by California state law. The attorneys and other staff employed by the office render legal services to individuals who are accused of public offenses, and who cannot afford to retain the services of a private attorney. They also represent any person under the age of 18 who is facing juvenile delinquency proceedings, or regarding whom the state has instituted wardship proceedings because of habitual truancy or incorrigibility. The public defender represents individuals who are involuntarily detained in medical facilities in a variety of mental health proceedings because of purported mental disabilities, those as to whom conservatorship proceedings have been instituted because they are alleged to be gravely disabled, and patients whose competency to refuse medical treatment is challenged. Finally, the public defender's office represents individuals who are subject to contempt proceedings for violation of court orders, such as child support and child visitation or custody orders. (More detail regarding the functions can be found in the frequently asked questions.)</p>\r\n                          <p>The attorney\u2019s role in the public defender's office is identical to that of a privately retained attorney.

Ask your mediator how it works in your court. Please remember that no matter how sensitive or understanding a judge or commissioner may be, that person does not know your children the way you do.

There is a filing fee. Once you have the financial information needed, you may file a \"Writ of Execution\". There is a fee for issuance of a Writ of Execution. A Writ of Execution is a court paper, which tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to pay your claim. The kinds of property an officer may be able to take: wages, bank accounts, automobiles, and business property or rental income. The Sheriff will charge a fee to execute the writ. If the debtor owns property you may want to record an abstract to place a lien so that you will be able to be paid if the property is purchased, sold or financed. There is an issuance fee. The abstract is recorded with the County Recorder in the county where the property is located. The Recorder will charge a fee to have the abstract recorded.<a href=\"../forms-filing/docs/copy-and-forms-fee.pdf\"> Download a printable civil filing\u00a0and appearance fees list</a></li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: I won my small claims case and the judgment debtor has paid me in full.

However, most tickets can be taken care of without appearing in court merely by paying the bail amount due on or before your court appearance date. By paying the bail amount without appearing in court, you will be convicted of the violation and the violation may appear on your record at the DMV. A point may be charged to your DMV record (depending on the violation) and your insurance may be adversely affected.<br>\r\n                              <br>\r\n                            If you fail to pay the bail or appear in court, you may be charged with a failure to appear. You may be arrested and punished by six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine regardless of the disposition of the original charge (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40508). In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided may be deemed to have elected a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. Your driver's license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency (Pen.

The fee must be collected on the day of service or will be deemed waived. You can obtain a juror attendance verification for your employer from the Clerk\u2019s Office.

{"body": ["<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n          <p>The rules are fairly simple and the hearing is informal. </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>The party filing the claim is the plaintiff. </li>\r\n            <li>The person being sued is the defendant. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>If you are the defendant and are filing a Claim of Defendant, you will remain the defendant and the plaintiff will remain the plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p> If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no right of appeal. So if you should lose, that's probably the end of the case. However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again. </p>\r\n          <p>If you are the plaintiff and a Claim of Defendant is filed (the defendant sues you on the same case) and you have a judgment against you, you may file an appeal on that decision. </p>\r\n          <h2>Small Claims Advisor </h2>\r\n          <p>The Self-Help Center has all of the small claim forms and is able to assist you with filling out the forms. </p>\r\n          <h2>Filing Your Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>Go to the court closest to you and obtain a small claims packet for filing your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Monetary Limits </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court has a monetary limit, called a jurisdictional limit, on the amount of money damages that a person can claim. The most you can ask for is $5,000; however, you are limited to filing no more than two claims anywhere in the State of California for over $2,500 in one calendar year. You may file an unlimited amount of claims for $2,500 or less. </p>\r\n          <h2>Role of the Court Clerk </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court clerks can answer many kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited by law to give legal advice. The Small Claims Advisory Clinic provides legal advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant. See the other helpful web sites listed below for information on filing a claim. </p>\r\n          <h2> Web Site to Help You File a Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>The California Courts\u2019 web site [http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm] has a section full of information needed to go through the process of a small claims suit, including an overview, forms, rules, tips, and much more. </p>\r\n          <h2>What to Expect in Court </h2>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Come to court organized and prepared.</li>\r\n            <li>Arrive promptly at your assigned court time; if you arrive late, your case may be heard without you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring enough photocopies of all your evidence for each party and the judge. </li>\r\n            <li>Any copies submitted to the judge the day of trial may not be returned to you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring all your witnesses. </li>\r\n            <li>If both parties are present, meaning both the plaintiff and the defendant, you will be asked to go into the hallway to exchange and review any documents that will be submitted to the judge as evidence. This must be done prior to the case being heard. </li>\r\n            <li>Have all your documents ready and in chronological order when your case is called. </li>\r\n            <li>There will be several other cases assigned to the same time as yours so you may have to wait to have your case heard. </li>\r\n            <li>You may be asked to sign a stipulation allowing a pro-tem judge (temporary judge) to hear your case. If you do not wish to have a temporary judge hear your case, your case may be continued to a date when there is a commissioner or judge of the Superior Court to hear your case. </li>\r\n            <li>You may decline a temporary judge when you file your claim and avoid a continuance to another date. </li>\r\n            <li>When your case is called, you will stand at a podium in front of the superior court judge or a pro-tem judge. You will be asked to present your evidence and give your testimony. Always address the judge and not the other party.\r\n              Usually, the plaintiff will give his/her testimony first and then the defendant.</li>\r\n            <li>The judge will probably ask questions to further his/her understanding of the case. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are the only party to appear at the trial and you are the plaintiff, you still must prove your case. Do not expect to \"automatically\" win your case if the other party does not appear. </li>\r\n            <li>The proceedings will not be recorded by a court reporter or by any other type of recording. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are not fluent in the English language, you must bring an interpreter with you. Small Claims courts do not provide interpreters. </li>\r\n            <li> The judge will usually not tell you the decision in court. The decision (judgment) will be mailed to you. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h2>If You Are The Defendant</h2>\r\n          <p>If you have been named as a defendant in a Small Claims action and have received an order to appear at a Small Claims hearing, this means that you are being sued. If you don't know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately for an explanation. </p>\r\n          <p>Never ignore an order to appear in court even if you think the case is wrong, unfair, or has no basis. If you do not appear in court at the proper time and date, the court may still hear and decide the case without you and you may lose the suit by default. </p>\r\n          <p>If you believe the plaintiff has caused you injury or owes you money for any reason, you can file a claim against the plaintiff in the same Small Claims court action. If your case is related to the subject of the plaintiff's case, it may be helpful and convenient to resolve it at the same hearing by filing a Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p>If judgment has been entered against you and the appeal time has lapsed, your money or property and maybe a portion of your earnings can then be taken legally by the judgment creditor to pay the judgment against you. A Small Claims judgment is public record. Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, these agencies come to the court often and place the judgment on the losing party's credit record even after the judgment is paid.</p>\r\n          <p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n   \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Small Claims"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/small-claims.shtml"},

There are three levels of severity of traffic violations: infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. Most traffic violations are infractions, but some, like vehicular manslaughter, are felonies. </p>\r\n          <p>Infractions are not punishable by jail or prison and are not subject to trial by jury; the punishment is a fine. Penalties for infractions can be as much as $200 or more for common traffic infractions including speeding, running a red light or stop sign.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Misdemeanors, such as driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, can carry penalties of as much as $2,000 or more and/or confinement in a city or county jail. The maximum penalty allowed in California for a misdemeanor is one year in county jail and/or a fine.\r\n            Felonies are punishable by formal probation or formal confinement in state prison. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infractions </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common infractions are moving violations without injury, such as speeding and running a red light. Drivers stopped for moving violations are usually released after they sign a Notice to Appear, printed on the ticket, agreeing to appear at a set date and time. The traffic ticket provides information about when to appear in court. Drivers charged with an infraction that want to admit guilt can avoid a court appearance by paying the fine in person or by mail. If drivers do not appear or pay the traffic fine within the authorized time, their driver?s license may be suspended. Usually they will not be able to renew their vehicle registration until they have paid all outstanding parking tickets and administrative costs in full. Drivers who plead not guilty and request a trial may be required to post bail or sign a written document to appear in court. If they fail to appear, they may be charged with the additional misdemeanor of violating their agreement to appear. In this case, a warrant may be issued for their arrest and their driving privilege may also be suspended. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Misdemeanors </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common misdemeanors are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and driving without a valid license. In some cases, drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be taken into custody. Drivers charged with almost all other traffic misdemeanors and infractions usually will not be taken into custody but will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear in court. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infraction Trials </h2>\r\n          <p>If a driver has been charged with a traffic violation they do not have the right to trial by a jury. The defendant may offer opposing evidence, argue the law, present supporting witnesses and other evidence, and cross-examine the law enforcement officer who issued the citation. </p>\r\n          <p>If a driver is judged \"not guilty,\" the bail will be refunded if previously posted. Drivers judged \"guilty\" must pay the fine or, in a serious misdemeanor, serve the sentence. People who willfully do not pay the fine and/or do not serve the sentence within the time authorized may be charged with contempt of court or failure to pay a fine, in which case court collections unit will begin to pursue the court-ordered debt from the individual. </p>\r\n          <h2>Driving Under the Influence </h2>\r\n          <p>The penalties for driving under the influence vary depending on the number of a driver's prior convictions for this offense.</p>\r\n          <p>A first-time violation can be punished by a jail term of not more than six months, a fine and penalty ranging from $1,000 to $2,700, and suspension or restriction of driving privileges for six months. Drivers with three DUI convictions within seven years normally receive jail terms of not less than 120 days nor more than one-year and a fine and penalty of not less than $1,053, and no more than $2,700. The person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be revoked for three years. </p>\r\n          <p>Drivers charged with a DUI must appear in court for an arraignment and may be requested to post bail. Bail can vary from $300 to $15,000. Whenever the possible sentences include jail time, the court, upon request, will appoint an attorney for drivers who cannot afford to hire one. </p>\r\n          <h2>How Parking Violations Are Settled </h2>\r\n          <p>Since July 1, 1993, legislation transferred the adjudication (settling) of parking tickets from the courts to the issuing agencies.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Only cases that are appealed because they cannot be settled after hearings with the issuing agency will come to the court.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <h2>Mandatory Automobile Insurance Law </h2>\r\n          <p>Under the mandatory insurance law, all drivers must carry evidence of financial responsibility and must provide that evidence to an officer on request. A driver who fails to provide proof of insurance on request by an officer during a traffic stop is guilty of an infraction.</p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant claims an inability to pay both the insurance and the fine or other financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to make installment payments or to pay the entire amount within a specified time. If you request installment payments, an additional $35.00 will be charged to your account.The court may reduce or waive the fine based on a defendant's inability to pay, but the Legislature specifically declared that it is in the interest of justice that the minimum fines for violations be enforced. In a case of extreme financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to substitute community service in place of payment of the fine. </p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant fails to pay the fine (or complete community service), the court may issue a warrant for the separate offense of failure to pay or obey a court order, may assess civil assessments, may impose additional fines, and may suspend the defendant's driving privileges. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Tickets </h2>\r\n          <p>If you are charged with a traffic misdemeanor or infraction, you usually will not be taken into custody. Instead, you will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear, often called a \"citation\" or a \"ticket.\" You may be taken into custody if you refuse to sign the citation; the arresting law enforcement officer also signs it.

The mediator's job is to be impartial, keep things fair, help you look at different options, help you come up with a calendar for times with the children, and support you in your efforts. </p>\r\n          <h2> Mediation Rules</h2>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Each parent is treated with respect and has an equal chance to explain his or her viewpoint and concerns. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent listens to the other and tries to find realistic solutions. </li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to put the children first and focus on what the children need and can handle.</li>\r\n            <li>Each parent is asked to show respect for the other and to recognize that their child has a right to a relationship with each of them. </li>\r\n            <li>Hitting, pushing, shoving, and threats of any type are not allowed and considered domestic violence. Mediation is to be a safe place for both parents. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p>The mediator's job is to see that these rules are followed. </p>\r\n          <h2>If There Has Been Domestic Violence </h2>\r\n          <p>If you or a family member has any concerns about domestic violence, please do three things:</p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Tell your lawyer if you have one. </li>\r\n            <li>Answer all of the questions from the judge or mediation intake person about this problem. </li>\r\n            <li>Talk to your mediator about this problem at the beginning of the mediation session. </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p><strong>KEEP IN MIND:</strong> The course of your session with the mediator can be determined by whether you have a domestic violence restraining order in effect and whether there has been a history of domestic violence between you and the other parent. In these cases, you have a right, subject to certain limitations, to have a support person with you during mediation and in the courtroom. You may also choose to see the mediator alone and at a different time from the other parent. </p>\r\n          <p>Also, if a mediator suspects any kind of child abuse, he or she is required by law to report it. Anyone who knowingly submits a false report of abuse is committing a crime. Ask your mediator for a list of community resources available to assist you and your children. </p>\r\n           <p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n\t\t  <h2>Orientation to Mediation</h2>\r\n          <p> The Mediation/Child Custody Recommending Counseling (CCRC) process begins with your completion of the mandatory <strong>Orientation to Mediation</strong>.

The judge will also tell you what the trial is about. </p>\r\n                      <p>Next, the judge and the attorneys will question each of the people in the jury box to find out if you can be fair and impartial in this particular case. </p>\r\n                      <p>One of the attorneys may \u201cchallenge you for cause.\u201d This means the attorney will ask the judge to excuse you from the jury for a specific legal reason. </p>\r\n                      <p>Each lawyer has an unlimited number of challenges for cause.\r\n                        \r\n                        Each attorney has the right to a certain number of peremptory challenges.

You should not guess or speculate about things not discussed in court, but you can draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence presented.</p>\r\n                      <p>It is important to take the case you are deciding seriously. After all, if you were a party in the case, it would be important to you, and you would want the jury to give it serious consideration even if the controversy appears less significant to others. </p>\r\n                      <p>All jurors should deliberate and vote on each issue to be decided in the case. When it is time to count votes, it is the foreperson's duty to see that this is done properly. In a civil case, the judge will tell you how many jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict. In a criminal case, the unanimous agreement of all 12 jurors is required. If the required number of jurors agree on each issue to be decided, the foreperson will sign and date the verdict, advise the bailiff or court attendant, and return with the signed verdict and any unsigned verdict forms from prior votes to the courtroom. </p>\r\n                      <p>If a jury cannot arrive at a verdict within a reasonable time and indicates to the judge that there is no possibility that they can reach a verdict, the judge, in his or her discretion, may dismiss the jury. This situation is a mistrial, sometimes referred to as a \"hung jury,\" and may mean the case goes to trial again with a new jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>When you have reached a verdict the foreperson will record your verdict on an official form. The bailiff will tell the judge you are ready and you will return to the jury box. The judge will ask if you reached a verdict. The foreperson will answer, handing the written verdict to the bailiff who in turn will hand it to the judge. The clerk will read the verdict aloud. Sometimes one of the parties will ask that the jury be polled. This means that the clerk will ask each juror if this is his or her own verdict. The jury service will then be complete. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Three Main Steps of a Jury Trial</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> California juries have been providing outstanding service and have set a high standard. The state of California and your trial judge thank you and all jurors for giving generously of your time and for taking jury service seriously.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 1: Selection of a Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>When a jury trial is about to begin, the trial court judge requests a panel of prospective jurors to be sent to the courtroom from the jury assembly room so that the jury selection process can begin. After reporting to a courtroom, the prospective jurors are first required to swear that they will truthfully answer all questions asked about their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>The perjury admonishment, which basically requires potential jurors to tell the truth when answering the questions, is read as follows: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will accurately and truthfully answer, under penalty of perjury, all questions propounded to you concerning your qualifications and competency to serve as a trial juror in the matter pending before this court, and that failure to do so may subject you to criminal prosecution? </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>The court clerk calls 12 or more jurors to take seats in the jury box. The judge speaks to the jurors, telling them the names of the people involved in the case and their attorneys and stating what the case is about. The judge and the attorneys ask jurors questions to determine if the jurors are free of bias (prejudice) or whether there is any reason why any of them cannot be fair and impartial; this process is called voir dire. It is important to ask questions if you do not understand a question. Also, each juror is obligated to follow the law as explained by the judge; if you cannot follow the law, you need to let the judge know.</p>\r\n                      <p>The law lets the judge and the lawyers excuse individual jurors from service in a particular case for various reasons. If a lawyer wants to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" to excuse the juror. Challenges can be for cause or peremptory. There are two types of juror challenges: a challenge for cause and a peremptory challenge. The process of questioning and excusing jurors continues until 12 persons are accepted as jurors for the trial. Alternate jurors may also be selected. The judge and attorneys agree that these jurors are qualified to decide impartially and intelligently the factual issues in the case. When the selection of the jury is completed, the jurors take the following oath: </p>\r\n                      <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\"Do you, and each of you, understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court, and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court?\" </p>\r\n                      </blockquote>\r\n                      <p>As a juror you should think seriously about the oath before taking it. The oath means you give your word to reach your verdict upon only the evidence presented in the trial and the court's instructions about the law. You cannot consider any other evidence or instruction other than those given by the court in the case before you. Remember that your role as a juror is as important as the judge's in making sure that justice is done. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 2: The Trial </h2>\r\n                      <h3>Jurors' duties during the trial: </h3>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not </strong>talk to others about the case. This responsibility requires that you not talk at all with the lawyers, witnesses, or anyone else connected with the case. The lawyers understand this rule. You will find that, even at the risk of seeming rude or unfriendly, the lawyers must avoid even casual conversation with you. In order to prevent even the appearance of improper conversation, a wise policy for you to follow is to avoid any contact with the lawyers or the parties. You also cannot talk to anybody about the case. There are important reasons for this: all cases must be decided only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you were to discuss the facts of the case or your impressions of it with your family, friends, or with any other person, you might hear their ideas and might be influenced by people who do not know all the facts. If you believe that someone has tried to speak to you about the case, you must report what happened to the judge by contacting the bailiff immediately. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> make up your mind before hearing all the evidence. It is also your duty not to form or express an opinion about the case to anyone. This means that you keep an open mind until you have heard the evidence from all sides and the case is given to the jury for deliberation. Only then may you discuss it with your fellow jurors and even then only when all jurors are present. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Do not</strong> conduct your own investigation of the case. It would also be a violation of your duty as a juror to conduct any investigation of the case. As a juror you must not become an amateur detective. For example, you must not visit the scene of an accident, an alleged crime, or any event or transaction involved in the case. You should not conduct experiments or consult any other person or reference works for additional information. If the judge feels that an inspection of a place is necessary or will be helpful, he or she will arrange and supervise an inspection by the whole jury. If you have a question about the evidence, let the judge know by handing a note to the bailiff and he or she will make a decision about your question. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Attorneys' opening statements</strong>: As the trial begins, the lawyer for the plaintiff in a civil case or the prosecutor in a criminal case may make an opening statement telling you what they expect the evidence to show. The defendant's lawyer may also choose to give an opening statement after the plaintiff's attorney or prosecutor, telling you what the defense expects the evidence to show. The lawyers' statements are not evidence. Their purpose is to give you the framework of the case, the points of conflict, and the issues of the case that you will need to decide. Be careful that you do not let any of the information presented in the opening statements become evidence in your mind. Remember that the lawyers' statements are only their versions of what happened, not evidence. </p>\r\n                      <p> <strong>Presentation of evidence</strong>: Evidence may be presented by the attorneys in the form of a written document or an object (a gun, another weapon, a photograph, an x-ray, or some other physical thing). These are called exhibits. Evidence may also include the testimony of witnesses under oath in the courtroom.\r\n                        \r\n                        Attorneys' closing statements: After all the evidence has been reviewed in court, lawyers for each side may present their final summary of the case, sometimes referred to as an argument. The lawyers can talk about reasons and make conclusions, but these are not evidence; they are efforts to persuade you. You should listen to these statements carefully and consider them thoughtfully, but you must form your own opinion about the outcome of the case based upon all evidence presented. </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Judge's Instructions on the Law</strong>: Either before or after the closing arguments by the lawyers, the judge will explain the law that applies to the case to you. This is the judge's instruction to the jury. You have to apply that law to the facts, as you have heard them, in arriving at your verdict. You must consider all of the instructions and give them equal consideration. Keep in mind that you must follow the law as the judge states it to you. If the judge gives you an instruction that seems different from what you read here or another instruction given at another trial, you must accept the instruction given by the judge of the case you are deciding as correct and be guided by the judge's statement only. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>When considering the evidence</strong>, an important difference exists between civil and criminal cases in the degree of proof required to sustain an accusation. In a criminal case, the defendant, in order to be convicted, must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, a party suing another has to prove that charge by a preponderance of the evidence. In every trial, the judge carefully explains the degree of proof required to reach a verdict. You should pay careful attention to the instructions on the degree of proof. </p>\r\n                      <h2>Step 3: Deliberations by the Jury </h2>\r\n                      <p>After closing statements by the attorneys and the judge's instructions on the law, the bailiff or court attendant will take you to the jury room for deliberations. Your first duty when entering the jury room is to select a foreperson. The jury should carefully select a well-qualified foreperson. The foreperson's duty is to see that discussion happens in a free and orderly manner, that the issues you must decide are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given an opportunity to participate. </p>\r\n                      <p>After you enter the jury room for deliberations, the exhibits that you are to consider are given to you. If you are not given written instruction from the judge on the law, you may request them. If you feel you need further instructions or to have certain testimony read back to you, inform the judge through the bailiff or the court attendant. Since these purposes can be accomplished only by returning everyone (including parties and lawyers) to the courtroom, you should not make these requests lightly. The procedure usually takes time, but this delay is understandable if you seriously believe doing so is necessary or helpful to you in reaching a verdict. There is a booklet, \"Behind Closed Doors\" that can assist jurors with the format of their deliberation. It is published by the American Judicature Society, which can be contacted at <a href=\"http://www.ajs.org\">http://www.ajs.org</a>. </p>\r\n                      <p>Quite often in the jury room the jurors may argue and have a difference of opinion. When this occurs, each juror should try to express his or her opinion and the reasoning supporting it. It would be wrong for a juror to refuse to listen to the arguments and opinions of the others or to deny another juror the right to express an opinion. Remember that jurors are not advocates, but impartial judges of the facts. By carefully considering each juror's opinion and the reasons behind it, it is usually possible for the jurors to reach a verdict. A juror should not hesitate to change his or her mind when there is a good reason. But each juror should maintain his or her position unless conscientiously persuaded to change that opinion by the other jurors. Following a full and free discussion with fellow jurors, each juror should vote only according to his or her own honest convictions. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">General Information</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li> <strong>Restrooms</strong> are located in the hallway in the Orland Branch and on the second floor of the courthouse in Willows. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Public Telephones</strong> are located in the hallway at the Orland Branch and across the street in Memorial Hall in Willows.</li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Children, relatives or friends</strong> are not permitted. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror Eligibility:</strong> All U.S. citizens who are over the age of 18, a resident of the county that issued the jury summons, and are able to understand the English language are eligible to serve on a jury in the State of California. Of these people, only convicted felons, meaning anyone who has been found guilty of a serious crime and are on probation, cannot serve. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Juror summons</strong>: Once you have received a jury summons, read the instructions carefully. If you have any questions, contact the jury office. Be sure to bring your summons with you when your report to court. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Term of Service</strong>: Jury service is a \"one day or one trial\" term of service. If you are selected to serve on a trial, you will serve for the duration of that one trial. Average length of a trial is two (2) to five (5) days, although trials can run longer. If you are not selected for a trial during your service day, your service obligation shall be complete for one year. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Compensation</strong>: California allows payment of $15 a day plus mileage, at the current rate according to federal standards, per mile one way for jury service. For reimbursement, ask your local jury office or the bailiff in the courtroom for more specific information for your local court. Although this is only a fraction of the cost of each juror's time, the courts are working with the Legislature and the Governor to increase juror fees. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There is ample parking at both courthouse locations. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Security</strong>: People entering the courthouse may be searched. Purses, briefcases, or other containers may also be searched. Weapons are prohibited in the courthouse facility. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Postponements</strong>: By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Orientation</strong>: You will be instructed regarding your jury service when you first appear. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Job and School</strong>: Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. This is the law. Section 230 of the California Labor Code is intended to prevent any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service and who has given reasonable notice of when the employee is to serve. Notice is generally considered reasonable if it is given as soon as possible once the employee has been summoned. The California Education Code (\u00a7\u00a7 44037 and 8 7036) and Rule of Court 5.5(d)(7) protect teachers, other school employees, and students as well. If you are harassed or fired, contact your local jury office or the judge assigned to your trial. If your employer has harassed you because of your service on a jury, contact the Department of Industrial Relation's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. You must complete a complaint form and turn it in to the Labor Board within six months from when the harassment happened. Remember to keep any certificate issued by the court clerk to prove that you served and for your employer's records. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Excuses for Undue Hardship</strong>: In certain serious cases, the jury commissioner or the judge may excuse you for up to one year. These are called undue hardship cases. If you have a personal situation that stops you from being able to serve, write that reason on your summons and mail it back or call the jury office. When listing reasons such as medical, job, or dependent care issues, be prepared to provide documentation to receive a postponement and not an excuse. </li>\r\n                        <li><strong>Disqualification</strong>: A person is disqualified or temporarily excused if he or she is a felon, nonresident, non-citizen, under a conservatorship, or in some cases, a peace officer. If you fall into one of these categories, contact the jury office to explain your situation. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Although we attempt to make jury service as convenient and efficient as possible, jurors should be advised that there will be times you will spend waiting. You may wish to bring something to occupy your time. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n              <!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>", "<div class=\"simpleModule3\">\r\n\t<h2>Public Notice: Jury Scam Alert\u00a0 \u00a0</h2>\r\n\t<p style=\"background:#efefef;color:#C3070A;font-weight:600;border:3px solid #C3070A;padding:20px;font-size:14px;\">The jury staff of the Superior Court of California, County of Glenn will never ask past or\r\n\tprospective jurors for financial details, credit card numbers, bank account or personal\r\n\tinformation like Social Security numbers.

After the court of appeal has made its decision, the party may seek review in the California Supreme Court. Death penalty appeals are decided only by the Supreme Court. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Thousands of cases are appealed in California every year. They include criminal convictions; civil cases involving personal injury, contract, employment, real estate, probate, dissolution of marriage, child custody and many other issues; and administrative matters, such as worker's compensation. In the vast majority of these cases, the decision of the court of appeal is final. The Supreme Court grants review of only a few Court of Appeal decisions when necessary to resolve novel or disputed questions of law. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>Proceedings in appellate courts are very different from those in trial courts. In trial courts, a judge or jury hears the testimony of witnesses, reviews physical evidence, exhibits and documents, and applies the law and reaches a decision. Appellate courts, on the other hand, do not decide an appeal by taking new evidence or reassessing the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the trial court. Rather, they review the written record to determine if the trial court properly interpreted the law and used the correct procedures when considering the case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>To ensure cases are examined from several perspectives, each Supreme Court case is heard by all seven of the high court's justices, while each court of appeal case is considered by a panel of three justices. Supreme and appellate court justices are assisted in their review by the parties' written and oral arguments. To decide a case in either court, a majority of the justices must agree. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All justices are bound to apply the law whether or not they personally agree with it. Justices may not substitute their own ideas for what the law should be, but are bound by the federal and state constitutions, statutes, and other rules and regulations legislated by those with the authority to do so, including the state legislature and voters by initiative. Judges must enforce all laws without being swayed by public opinion. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges to \"be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism ...\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, and is designed specifically to foster judges' independence from improper external pressures. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The California Constitution generally requires appellate courts to decide a case in a written opinion setting forth the facts and rules of law upon which the decision is made. By constitutional mandate, the decision must be issued within 90 days after the case has been taken under submission or the justices hearing the case cannot receive their pay. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Important appellate opinions are published in law books and by electronic means, which are available to judges, lawyers, the public, and the news media. Such opinions become rules of law, which govern future disputes. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>In 1996-1997, 18,802 criminal, juvenile, and civil cases were noticed for appeal. During the same period, appellate courts affirmed 95 percent of the criminal and juvenile cases, and 76 percent of the civil cases they heard. Whenever an appellate court reverses, it almost always allows the trial court to rehear the case using the correct law and procedures. Before you file an appeal, you should read this information carefully. You are responsible for preparing all documents and doing any legal research you feel is necessary. The clerk cannot advise you on any legal issues or advise you as to the content of any papers required. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>When you appeal, you are asking the appellate court to review a decision of the trial judge because you disagree with it. The court cannot review questions of fact. It can only decide if there was an error of law that was serious enough to have prevented you from having a fair trial. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The appellate court cannot retry the case. No witnesses can be heard, and the court cannot consider any evidence that was not presented at trial. It cannot consider conflicting evidence or choose to believe you instead of the other witnesses. The trial judge's determinations of credibility and conflicts in the evidence are binding in the appellate court. The appellate court can only look at the record on appeal and decide whether the trial judge's decision in the case is supported by substantial evidence. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>The things you must do to be sure your appeal will be heard are in the California Rules of Court, California Rules 101 through 108 apply to all appeals. Rules 121 through 144 apply to civil appeals, and Rules 182 through 191apply to appeals of traffic infractions and criminal cases. If you do not follow the rules carefully, you may lose the chance to have your appeal considered. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>All papers filed with the court must be served on the opposing party or that party's lawyer and must have a valid proof of service attached. </p>\r\n   \t\t  <p>The most important act in an appeal is filing the written notice of appeal. This notice must be filed with the Appeals unit before the deadline. There are many time limits and regulations in proceeding with an appeal. Please read the California Rules of Court to verify that you meet the time limits for every step. Failure to meet some time limits may result in dismissal of your appeal. </p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Note: If you do not file the notice of appeal on time, the appellate court cannot consider your case.</p>\r\n      \t\t<p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Appeals"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/appeals.shtml"},

One is to evaluate the validity of charges being brought by a prosecutor, if the charges are not reviewed by a judge, to ensure that they are not frivolous or ungrounded. The other is to inquire into, and investigate if necessary, the operations of local government agencies and officials to ensure that activities are valid and services are efficiently and legally provided. In both instances, the secrecy of the grand jury's deliberations is a common thread that ensures independent and objective consideration of facts brought before it.</p>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   <div class=\"simpleModule\">\r\n\r\n          \r\n            <!--- Begin Accordion --->\r\n             \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2Wrap\">\r\n                                        \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n                        document.write(\"<div class=\\\"controls2\\\"><a class=\\\"expandall\\\" href=\\#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.expandall('trigger2'); return false\\\">expand all<\\/a> <a class=\\\"collapseall\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"ddaccordion.collapseall('trigger2'); return false\\\">collapse all<\\/a><\\/div>\");\r\n                        </script>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                \r\n   \r\n     <div class=\"trigger2\">An Invitation to Participate in the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> You can make a difference </h4>\r\n                      <p> Participation in Grand Jury investigation and discussion is a rich and rewarding experience. It is an opportunity to get an intimate look at how government works and to make informed and valuable recommendations regarding possible improvements.

Citizens are also encouraged to volunteer to be considered as a prospective Grand Juror through public announcements through local radio and television stations and press. Every effort is made to recruit both men and women from all socioeconomic levels, ethnic groups and age groups.\r\n                        \r\n                        Applications for grand jury service are given an initial review by Court Administration to ensure that each applicant meets the qualifications to be a grand juror as outlined in this pamphlet. After the initial review, qualified applicants are scheduled for an interview with the Grand Jury Selection Committee. The Selection Committee is comprised of the Court\u2019s Judges, Executive Officer, and the incoming and outgoing Grand Jury forepersons.\r\n                        \r\n                        After the interviews, qualified prospective Grand Jurors are summoned to appear in court where all names are placed in a lottery draw. The first 19 names chosen become the next Glenn County Grand Jury. The remaining names are drawn to provide alternates.\r\n                        \r\n                        Shortly before the beginning of the term of service, July 1 through June 30, a training program is conducted for incoming Grand Jurors pursuant to PC \u00a7914(b). The foreperson is selected by the Presiding Judge.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <h4>Commitment/Compensation </h4>\r\n                      <p>The complex, diverse responsibilities of grand jurors make it necessary to give a serious commitment to the time requirements. The usual work schedule is one to two evenings per month, although some day or weekend meetings may be required. However, each grand jury sets the dates and times of their meetings that is most convenient for all members. Jurors are provided with meeting facilities and parking, as well as a stipend. Reimbursement for the mileage to and from meetings is allowed at the regular county rate. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Application and Contact Information </h4>\r\n                      <p>For more information or a grand jury application, please write, email, or call:<br>\r\n                        \r\n                        Superior Court of California,                     County of Glenn<br>\r\n                        Office of the Jury Commissioner<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988<br>\r\n                        (530) 934-6382</p>\r\n                      <p> <a href=\"documents/Juror%20Questionnaire%209_2020.pdf\">Download the pdf version of the questionnaire here</a> If you are interested in participating in the Grand Jury process, please send a completed questionnaire to: </p>\r\n                      <p>Court Administrative Assistant<br>\r\n                        526 West Sycamore Street<br>\r\n                        Willows, California 95988</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n              <div class=\"trigger2\">History of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> Before American Development </h4>\r\n                      <p> Some historians believe that the earliest versions of the grand jury existed in Athens, where the Greeks used citizen groups to develop accusations. Others find traces of the concept in all the Teutonic peoples, including early Anglo-Saxons. For example, the concept was employed in the early Scandinavian countries. Evidence also exists that the early French developed the \"King's Audit\" involving citizens who were sworn and required to provide fiscal information related to the operation of the kingdom.\u00a0 </p>\r\n                      <p>However, most commentators believe that the grand jury arose as an institution in England. In the first millennium, English individuals prosecuted criminals, with the king personally involved in the system. Under the Doom Law of Anglo-Saxon King Aethelred (980-1016), a dozen landowners were appointed to investigate alleged crimes. In 1166, King Henry II established a system of local informers (twelve men from every one hundred) to identify those who were \"suspected of\" various crimes. If the suspects survived their \"trials by ordeal\", they paid fines to the King. However, the \"informers\" were fined if they failed to indict any suspect, or even enough suspects. After 1188, they became tax collectors as well, and after the reign of Henry III, they were charged with looking into the condition and maintenance of public works. </p>\r\n                      <p> The Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215, did not mention the grand jury specifically, but did establish various procedures to ensure fairness in the dispensation of justice. Thereafter, until the mid-1300's, the 12-man juries served both to present indictments and also to rule on the validity of charges. During Edward III's reign, from 1312-1377, the 12 individuals were replaced by 24 knights, called \"le grande inquest\", and the 12 became a \"petit jury\" responsible only for declaring innocent or guilty verdicts. </p>\r\n                      <p> Ultimately, in the 1600's, the English grand jury developed as a process to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that an accused individual was guilty of a crime. Grand juries reached their English pinnacle of citizen protectors in 1681, when they refused to indict enemies of King Charles II for alleged crimes. (Ironically, English laws establishing grand juries were repealed in 1933.)</p>\r\n                      <h4>Early American Development</h4>\r\n                      <p>The use of juries in earliest colonial history was limited. In the New Haven colony, for example, religious beliefs resulted in the residents eliminating trial by jury because there was no reference to juries in the laws of Moses. However, procedures similar to grand juries were used to hear criminal charges of larceny (Boston, 1644), holding a disorderly meeting (Plymouth, 1651), and witchcraft (Pennsylvania, 1683). In the early 1600's, colonial representatives of the English monarchs made laws and prosecuted violators. The first grand juries recommended civil charges against those crown agents, thus establishing themselves as representatives of the governed, similar to grand juries today. The first grand juries also looked into government misconduct or neglect. For example, the first colonial grand jury, established in Massachusetts in 1635, \"presented\" town officials for neglecting to repair stocks, as well as considering cases of murder, robbery and spousal abuse. </p>\r\n                      <p>Other early grand juries performed a variety of administrative functions, including audits of county funds (New Jersey), inspections of public buildings (Carolinas), and review of taxes and public works (Virginia). Virginia grand juries also investigated whether each family planted two acres of corn per person.</p>\r\n                      <p>In the Colonies, grand juries were considering criminal accusations and investigating government officials and activities, but with a populist view. Grand jurors included popular leaders such as Paul Revere and John Hancock's brother. These grand juries played a critical role in the pre-Revolutionary period: for example, three grand juries refused to indict John Peter Zenger, whose newspaper criticized the royal governor's actions in New York (he ultimately was prosecuted by the provincial attorney, defended by Alexander Hamilton, and acquitted). Grand juries also denounced arbitrary royal intrusions on citizens' rights, refused to indict the leaders against the Stamp Act of 1765, and refused to bring libel charges against the editors of the Boston Gazette in 1766. </p>\r\n                      <p>After the Revolutionary War ended, the new federal constitution did not include a grand jury. Early American leaders such as John Hancock and James Madison objected. Thereafter, the grand jury was included in the Bill of Rights, as part of the Fifth Amendment, which states, \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger...\" </p>\r\n                      <p>From then, until today, the federal grand jury remains an integral part of the justice system, used by federal prosecutors for a variety of potential crimes. In 1801, a federal grand jury indicted Colonel Aaron Burr for treason. Most recently, federal grand juries considered allegations related to the Oklahoma City and New York Trade Center bombings, President Clinton's conduct both before and during his term of office, and the recent claims of wrong-doing by former California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and some associates. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Adaptation by the States </h4>\r\n                      <p>As the various states were admitted to the Union and adopted their legal and operating procedures, almost every one initially included some reliance on grand juries for either (or both) review of criminal indictments or inquiries into government activities. Some states' grand juries were very active in administrative affairs, even including recommending new laws. Others carried out investigations of government officials; one Tennessee grand jury indicted the entire state court of appeals and another opposed a judge's reappointment on the grounds of \"mental imbecility\". </p>\r\n                      <p>Throughout this state-by-state development, the underlying concept remained the same: ordinary citizens, neighbors, and others on grand juries were a necessary part of government to ensure that public prosecutors were not swayed by personal or political prejudices, and that government officials efficiently and effectively performed their jobs. </p>\r\n                      <p>Since the mid-1800's, grand juries have been criticized as ineffective or out-of-date by a number of reformers because they were slow, lacked expertise, and on other grounds. Others criticized the \"star chamber\" atmosphere of secret hearings without customary due process rights. However, these complaints were offset by effective grand jury investigations, including those of the Boss Tweed ring in New York City (1871) and racketeering charges brought by a grand jury assisted by Thomas Dewey in the 1930's. Since the nineteenth century, various minor and major changes have been made in grand jury selection, procedures, and qualifications, often resulting in fairer and more efficient jury operations. </p>\r\n                      <p>Today, all states except Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, may use grand juries to indict and begin criminal trials. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia require that grand jury indictments be used for certain-more serious-crimes. California and twenty-four other states make use of grand jury indictments optional. All states and the District of Columbia use grand juries for investigative purposes. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">The Grand Jury's Role</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Prosecutions </h4>\r\n                      <p>Although the American grand jury originally was conceived as a protector of ordinary citizens by other ordinary citizens, the fairness of its criminal operations has been questioned by various commentators and judges. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas stated, \"It is, indeed, common knowledge that the Grand Jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the Government, is now a tool of the Executive.\" Some even have referred to it as a \"rubber stamp\" for prosecutors. In the criminal system, the California constitution and laws provide that felony prosecutions are initiated only after a determination that there is \"probable cause\" to believe that specific individuals committed specific crimes. This is done either by \"information\" presented for examination and approval by a judge, or by indictment after a grand jury hearing and vote. In either case, the purpose of the objective review is to prevent overzealous prosecutors from unjustified, groundless, or unfair prosecutions when \"probable cause\" does not exist. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury operates without providing many fundamental rights common in court hearings and trials. For example, the defendant has neither the right to present evidence to the grand jury or cross-examine the witnesses against him or her. Only the prosecutor may present evidence, and the defendant has no right to counsel, even if required to testify. Even judges generally are excluded, leaving the grand jurors to rely on the prosecutor for all information. One early study indicated that 95% of all cases brought to the grand jury resulted in indictments, raising questions about the value of this review because the grand jury is not able to adequately evaluate the evidence presented only by the district attorney. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The role of the grand jury in civil investigations presents an interesting twist: the original (English) grand juries served to aid the government in finding and prosecuting private citizens' misdeeds; now, these juries investigate and accuse public figures, defending individual citizens' rights and expectations. Grand juries, both federal and state, may investigate criminal activity or non-criminal activities. In California, for example, the grand jury can investigate any activity by a public official (other than court), which violates a state law, and many other activities, as long as they occur within the county of the grand jury. </p>\r\n                      <p>State grand juries, but not federal grand juries, can investigate any non-criminal activity and report and make recommendations based on the results of the investigation. These investigations commonly include reviewing the operation and condition of jails and prisons, investigating the conduct of local public officials, and other similar matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The results of these investigations may be criminal charges, recommendations for new laws, or merely reports to the public identifying problems but proposing no specific solutions.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                    \r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Duties of the Grand Jury</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <h4>\r\n                            \r\n                      Government Watchdog</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In California today, provisions of the Penal Code to require the grand jury:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Investigate and report on the accounts, records, operations, and functions of district, city and county government and public officials (Penal Code \u00a7 925 &amp; 925a); it may also inquire into the affairs of joint powers agencies located in the county. </li>\r\n  <li>Inquire into the condition and management of all correctional facilities within the county (Penal Code \u00a7 919(b)). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The grand jury may investigate or inquire into county matters of civil concern, such as the needs of county officers, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of the several offices. </p>\r\n<h4>Powers permitted to the grand jury include:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Free access, at reasonable times, to public prisons; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine all public records within the county;</li>\r\n  <li>The right to examine books and records of <ul>\r\n  <li>any incorporated city, or joint powers agency located in the county; </li>\r\n  <li>certain redevelopment agencies and housing authorities; </li>\r\n  <li>special-purpose assessing or taxing districts wholly or partly within the county; &amp; </li>\r\n  <li>non-profit corporations established by or operated on behalf of a public entity; </li></ul></li>\r\n  <li>The authority to investigate and report on operations and methods of performing duties of any such city, county, or joint powers agency and to make recommendations as deemed proper; </li>\r\n  <li>The ability, with permission of the Superior Court, to hire experts such as auditors and accountants; </li>\r\n  <li>The right to inquire into the sale, transfer and ownership of lands which might or should escheat to the state. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Note:\t</strong>The grand jury has no authority to investigate the courts or the acts or commissions of any judge or judicial employee.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Criminal Indictments</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Constitution permits criminal trial on the basis of indictment by a grand jury or by information after the district attorney recommends prosecution and a judge agrees that facts exist which warrant prosecution. In addition, under \u00a7 917 of the Penal Code, \"the grand jury may inquire into all public offenses committed or triable within the county, and present them to the court by indictment.\" In actual practice, grand juries seldom initiate such inquiries; rather, such offenses are generally brought to the grand jury by the district attorney, who asks for and generally receives an indictment, upon presentation of adequate facts.\r\n\r\n</p><p>According to the California Grand Jurors Association, the district attorney much more frequently bypasses the grand jury and uses the process known as a preliminary hearing. A 1954 survey of California district attorneys listed the following factors as influential in the decision to seek a grand jury indictment rather than using the preliminary hearing: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>High public interest in the case; </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that a preliminary hearing would take more time than a grand jury hearing; </li>\r\n  <li>The necessity for calling children or witnesses who would be subject to cross-examination at a preliminary hearing;</li>\r\n  <li>The existence of a weak or doubtful case which the district attorney wishes to test; </li>\r\n  <li>Cases involving malfeasance in office; and </li>\r\n  <li>The fact that witnesses are in a state prison. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A more recent study adds the following reasons for using the grand jury: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Cases where the defendant cannot be located and the time limit under the statute of limitations is about to expire, </li>\r\n  <li>Where the secrecy of the grand jury may allow defendants to be charged and taken into custody before they can pose potential danger to a witness's safety or flee from the jurisdiction, </li>\r\n  <li>The need to protect the identity of undercover agents, </li>\r\n  <li>And the ability to test a witness before a jury. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>From 1978 until 1990, grand juries were seldom used for indictments. A California Supreme Court ruling required holding preliminary hearings even if grand jury indictments were obtained. In 1990, a constitutional amendment made significant alterations in California criminal law and court procedures, including a provision that defendants were not entitled to preliminary hearings if indicted by a grand jury. As noted above, recent statutes (Penal Code \u00a7 904.6) give district attorneys the option of using special grand juries chosen from the regular jury pool to handle criminal cases and thus ensure indictment by those who represent a cross section of the community. Although the law allows criminal indictments to be brought by a grand jury, in practice, the District Attorney generally prefers to use the speedier preliminary hearing process.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">California Grand Juries</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <h4> An Overview </h4>\r\n                      <p>Grand Juries are impaneled in every county in California. Article I, \u00a723 of the California Constitution states: \"a grand jury shall be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each county.\" Depending on a county's population, a specified number of citizens ranging from 11 to 23 in each of California's 58 counties are empowered to investigate and report on various activities of county and city government. The rules governing the makeup, organization, powers and duties of grand juries in California are found in the California Penal Code \u00a7888-939. Recent changes in the Penal Code (\u00a7904.6, 1991) permit any county to have an additional grand jury at the discretion of the presiding judge of the superior court. </p>\r\n                      <p>The statutes permit some variation in the manner and time of selection of jurors and require only that the term of service be for one year and coincide with the County's fiscal year. Qualifications for grand jurors are outlined in Penal Code \u00a7 893. This section requires the prospective grand juror be at least 18 years old, in possession of their natural faculties and have sufficient knowledge of the English language. In Sacramento County, each grand jury begins its term July 1 and ends its service June 30 of the following year. Throughout the State, prospective grand jurors in each county are chosen through a lengthy process that includes application, screening by the jury commissioner from Department of Motor Vehicle Records, voter rolls, and nomination of interested persons by Superior Court Judges. A thorough background check is made on all interested persons and list of qualified candidates is submitted to the judges for review and approval. Since some members of the existing grand jury may be carried over for a second term, the number of names drawn will equal those needed to provide a grand jury of 19 members. (The law allows for a grand jury of 23 in counties with greater than four million population and for 11 members in counties with less than 20,000 population. (Penal Code \u00a7888.2)) It has been the practice in many counties to advertise widely and to encourage many people to apply for the grand jury. Because grand jury service requires the devotion and commitment for only a token payment, it is desirable for grand jurors to have an interest in community affairs and be open-minded with a true concern for the views of others. Grand jurors also should posses some investigative skills and be able to take good notes and write and type reports. A good knowledge of the functions and responsibilities of city and county government is also helpful. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Investigation of Complaints and Accusations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury also is likely to receive a number of citizen complaints, many of which involve operations of county or city agencies or special districts. Whether the complaint is civil or criminal, rules of secrecy apply, and during the course of its investigation, the grand jury may not divulge the subject or methods of inquiry. The subject of the investigation and the methods of inquiry are only revealed when the final report is published. Privileged or confidential material is not included in the grand jury reports. Thus the names of those questioned and facts that might lead to the identity of a person who provided information to the grand jury are not released. \u00a7 919(c) of the Penal Code requires the grand jury to inquire into the willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Where misconduct is found, the grand jury may file an accusation leading to a trial. If the official is convicted, the person is thereby removed from office. Very few of these accusations are filed. Frequently, if there is misconduct in office, it is of a criminal nature, and an indictment rather than an accusation would be issued. It is also possible that an official would resign rather than face an accusation. The grand jury may file an accusatory pleading against a corporation doing business in its county of jurisdiction (Penal Code \u00a7 892). In a report published by the California Grand Jurors Association, misconduct in office could include any of the following: </p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Nonfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The failure to act where duty requires an act; or</li>\r\n                        <li>Neglect or refusal, without sufficient cause or excuse, to do that which is the officer's legal duty to do, whether willfully or through malice; or </li>\r\n                        <li>Willful neglect of duty. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Misfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The improper or doing of an act that a person might lawfully do; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a duty or act that one ought to do or has a right to do, but in manner such as to infringe upon the rights of others. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <p><strong>Malfeasance:</strong> </p>\r\n                      <ol>\r\n                        <li>The performance of an act that is positively unlawful or wrong; or</li>\r\n                        <li>The performance of a wrongful act that the person has no legal right to do. </li>\r\n                      </ol>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Reports</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> State Law requires that each grand jury submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the presiding judge of the Superior Court. </p>\r\n                      <p>A report, just as an accusation or an indictment, must be approved by at least 12 of the 19 grand jurors (15 if it is a 23 member jury). With so many possible investigations and a term limited to a single year, it is necessary for each grand jury to make hard decisions as to what it wishes to undertake during the term. Except for mandated duties to report on the financial condition of the county and on the conditions of county jails, the grand jury discretion in determining its agenda. Most grand juries divide into committees for conducting investigations and for writing reports, but there seems to be a wide variation between counties as to the number and structure of committees; it is up to each grand jury to determine its own method of operation within the parameters of the law. </p>\r\n                      <p>Government agencies that are the subject of reports are required by law to respond to specific grand jury findings and recommendations. However, the grand jury has no enforcement power, and the agencies are under no legal obligation to carry out the recommendations. While some recommendations are ignored, others are followed; particularly those that suggest greater efficiency for operations and that do not require the expenditure of large sums of money. Grand jury criticisms of public officials and agencies frequently attract press attention, bringing greater community awareness of what is happening in public agencies. Many grand jurors believe that public officials tend to be more accountable when they know an impartial; outside body is looking over their collective shoulders. </p>\r\n                      <p>The California Grand Jurors Association (CGJA) (www.cgja.org), a statewide organization of former grand jurors has begun a program of identifying and indexing grand jury reports in each county with the hope of establishing a state archive of annual reports. The State Library also maintains an archive of grand jury reports from all counties. CGJA also monitors and occasionally proposes or endorses proposed laws to conserve and improve the grand jury as an important institution of local government. It offers services to those grand juries that may request advice and help in preparing informational manuals and in providing orientation for incoming jurors. Some members of the CGJA now provide orientation programs for those counties that request this service. </p>\r\n                      <p>While surrounded by secrecy before publication, grand jury reports become public documents when signed by the grand jury foreman and approved by the grand jury's advisory judge. Copies are sent: to all targeted government agencies, to interested officials, to public and private groups and individuals and to the press. At the end of the year, bound or loose-leaf copies of all reports are placed in all public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <h4>Online Grand Jury Reports</h4>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2018-2019%20Final%20Grand%20Jury%20Report.pdf\">2018 - 2019 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>                        \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2017-2018_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2017 - 2018 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2016-2017_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2016 - 2017 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2015-2016_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2015 - 2016 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2014-2015_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2014 - 2015 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2013-2014_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2013 - 2014 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2012-2013_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2012 - 2013 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2011-2012_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2011 - 2012 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2010-2011_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2010 - 2011 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2009-2010_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2009 - 2010 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2007-2008_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2007 - 2008 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2006-2007_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2006 - 2007 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2005-2006_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2005 - 2006 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2004-2005_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2004 - 2005 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2003-2004_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2003 - 2004 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2002-2003_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2002 - 2003 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Report-Revised_Response_02-23.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report-Revised</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2001-2002_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2001 - 2002 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"documents/2000-2001_Grand_Jury_Final_Report.pdf\">2000 - 2001 Grand Jury Final Report</a></li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n\t   \r\n\t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Criminal/Civil Functions</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The major functions of a grand jury are divided into criminal indictments and civil investigations. While the same panel in Glenn County executes both functions, the civil investigation portion requires the majority of the jury\u2019s time. California Penal Code section 904.0(a) allows the presiding judge of Superior Court to impanel one additional grand jury. The additional grand jury would have sole jurisdiction to return criminal indictments.</p>\r\n                      <h4>Criminal Indictments </h4>\r\n                      <p>The District Attorney will bring the majority of cases that are presented to the grand jury; however, the State Attorney General or a Special Prosecutor may present a case. The responsibility of the grand jury does not extend beyond the determination of whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has committed such crime.\r\n                        \r\n                        Criminal indictment hearings are conducted in secrecy to protect witnesses and defendants in cases of no indictment. During a criminal investigation only District Attorney representatives and a court reporter are allowed in the jury room, with a few exceptions. No person other than a grand juror may be present during deliberations or voting. An indictment can be returned only if a minimum of 12 jurors agrees. </p>\r\n                      <p>Historically, the grand jury indictment process is used for cases where: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Public officials, employees, or police officers are involved </li>\r\n                        <li>Statute of limitations is a concern</li>\r\n                        <li>The indictment is complex and must be presented over a long period of time </li>\r\n                        <li>Grand jury subpoena powers are necessary </li>\r\n                        <li>Secrecy and non-adversary nature for sensitive cases are needed, such as cases involving children or rape victims </li>\r\n                        <li>Criminal indictments are extremely rare in Glenn County. </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <h4>Civil Investigations </h4>\r\n                      <p>The civil, or \u201cwatchdog\u201d, responsibilities of the grand jury encompass the examination of all aspects of county government, including special districts, to ensure that the county is being governed honestly and efficiently and that county monies are being handled appropriately. </p>\r\n                      <p>The grand jury is mandated by law to inquire into the conditions and management of public jails.\r\n                        \r\n                        The grand jury may conduct investigations on public agencies and on the administration and affairs of any city within the county, as well as examine books and records of redevelopment agencies. It is also appropriate for any private citizen, county official or county employee to present a written complaint to the grand jury for investigation. </p>\r\n                      <p>During its term, the grand jury selects the government affairs it wishes to investigate. These investigations are generally conducted by committees, which correspond with the primary functions of the county. Committees may ask for support and advice from the Superior Court Presiding Judge, District Attorney, County Counsel, Attorney General, or outside consultants. </p>\r\n                      <p>On the last day of each year of service, the grand jury is required by law to submit all final reports to the Presiding Judge. These reports include all studies and investigations conducted by the grand jury during its term, with appropriate recommendations. Copies of individual reports are submitted to each county entity investigated, with instructions that response to findings/recommendations be made by the responsible governing body within 60 or 90 days. </p>\r\n                      <p>Past grand jury reports are available for inspection by the public at most public libraries. </p>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Complaint Form</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <p>\r\nDownload a <a href=\"documents/Grand_Jury_Complaint_Form.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Jury complaint form</a>. </p> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n\r\n\t   \t                 \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Grand Jury Qualifications</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p> The law states grand jury applicants must have these qualifications: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Citizen of the United States, 18 years of age or older</li>\r\n                        <li>Resident of state and county for at least one year prior to being selected </li>\r\n                        <li>In possession of natural faculties, ordinary intelligence, sound judgment, fair character </li>\r\n                        <li>Possess sufficient knowledge of the English language </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Applicants are disqualified if any of the following apply: </p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as a trial juror in any court in the state</li>\r\n                        <li>Presently serving as an elected public official </li>\r\n                        <li>Discharged as a grand juror in any court in the state within one year </li>\r\n                        <li>Convicted of malfeasance in office or any felony or other high crime </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <p>Beyond the legal requirements, several other qualifications are desirable for a grand juror:</p>\r\n                      <ul>\r\n                        <li>General knowledge of the functions, authorities, and responsibilities of county and city government and of other civil entities </li>\r\n                        <li>Research abilities, including ability to read and comprehend complex material, a background in accessing/analyzing facts and experience in report writing </li>\r\n                        <li>Background in group/committee work </li>\r\n                        <li>Good to excellent health </li>\r\n                        <li>Respect and objectivity concerning the positions and views of others </li>\r\n                      </ul>\r\n                      <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n<!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Grand Jury"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/grand-jury.shtml"},

The number of peremptory challenges have been established by the Legislature.</td>\r\n   \t\t                  </tr>\r\n   \t\t                </tbody>\r\n   \t\t              </table>\r\n   \t\t            </blockquote>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Civil case/civil suit:</strong>\u00a0A lawsuit is called a civil case when it is between two or more individuals or corporations involved in a dispute and usually seeking a judgment awarding monetary damages. A civil case is an action brought to enforce, redress, or protect private rights. Civil actions include:</p>\r\n      \t\t        <ul>\r\n      \t\t          <li>General Civil (seeking damages over $25,000)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Limited Civil (seeking damages under $25,000)\u00a0Family Law</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Probate</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Unlawful Detainer (landlord/tenant disputes)</li>\r\n      \t\t          <li>Small Claims (seeking damages under $5,000)</li>\r\n   \t\t            </ul>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Common law:\u00a0</strong>The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from constitutions or statutes.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Compulsory:</strong>\u00a0Compelled; mandated by legal process or by statute.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Constitution:</strong>\u00a0The fundamental law of our nation. It establishes the character and organization of America's sovereign power and the manner of its exercise. Also, the document that contains the guiding rules and principles, the descriptions of the power of the federal government, and the essential rights of the people.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Controversy:</strong>\u00a0A disagreement or a dispute that requires a definitive determination of how the law applies to the facts that are asserted to be true.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Counsel:</strong>\u00a0One or more lawyers who represent a client.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p>Criminal prosecution/criminal case: The act of pursuing a criminal trial, where the state charges someone with a crime. A criminal case is an action brought by the government against a person who has broken the law. Criminal cases are separated into three main categories; felony, misdemeanors, and infractions</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Degree of proof:</strong>\u00a0The amount of proof necessary to prove a case. In a criminal case, such proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Deliberations:</strong>\u00a0This occurs after a trial when a jury goes into its assigned private room to think about and discuss evidence and testimony to help it reach a verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Directed verdict:</strong>\u00a0After evidence has been presented and if no issue of fact remains for the jury to determine, the judge will tell the jury what verdict to return. The jury must return that verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Disqualification (juror)</strong>: The condition of having been rendered not qualified to serve.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Eligible/eligibility ( for jury duty):</strong>\u00a0Every person who is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the respective county, able to understand the English language, not currently serving on any other jury, and who has not been convicted of a felony is eligible to serve as a juror (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 203).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong>\u00a0Any type of legal proof presented at trial through witnesses, records, and/or exhibits.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exemptions/excuses/postponements (for jury service):</strong>\u00a0By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong>\u00a0Document or material object produced and identified in court as evidence in a case. Each of these documents or objects is ordinarily given an identifying letter or number in alphabetical or numerical sequence when it is offered as evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Felon:</strong>\u00a0A person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Foreperson:</strong>\u00a0Often called the \"presiding juror.\" At the beginning of deliberations, the jury votes to select one of its members to be the foreperson. The jury foreperson's duty is to preside and see that discussion during deliberations is carried on in a free and orderly manner, that the case and issues are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given a chance to participate in the discussion. As the deliberations conclude, the foreperson counts the votes and completes and signs the verdict form.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Impartial:</strong>\u00a0Without bias, prejudice, or other preconception. The members of a jury should have no opinion about or vested interest in a case at the start of the trial and should base their verdict only on competent legal evidence presented during the trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong>\u00a0The guidelines given by the judge at the beginning and end of a trial that explain what the law in the case is and how the jurors should evaluate the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury pool:</strong>\u00a0The group of prospective qualified jurors appearing for assignment to trial jury panels.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury summons:</strong>\u00a0The papers sent to potential jurors that require their attendance in court for possible service on a jury. California courts summon jurors to the courthouse no more than once in any given 12-month period.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury selection:</strong>\u00a0The process by which jurors for a particular trial are selected from the larger group of potential jurors summoned to the courthouse. Once the jurors arrive in the courtroom, the judge and lawyers ask the jurors questions for the purpose of determining whether jurors are free of bias, or prejudice, or anything might interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Juvenile Case:</strong>\u00a0Juvenile cases are those involving minors under the age of 18 years. These are separated into two main categories--Juvenile Delinquency for minors who have broken the law and Juvenile Dependency for minors who have been removed from the home and/or care of their parents or guardians.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Litigants:</strong>\u00a0Any persons or groups engaged in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>One-day/one-trial:</strong>\u00a0California courts have adopted the one-day or one-trial system. One day or one trial means that prospective jurors have to come to the court only once. If you are not chosen for a trial, then your term of service is complete for one year. If you do serve on a jury, you will not be required to report for jury service for at least another 12 months.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Pending:</strong>\u00a0In process; not yet decided.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Perjury:</strong>\u00a0A false statement made willfully and knowingly while under oath in a court proceeding.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Polled/polling:</strong>\u00a0Calling the names of the jurors and having them state what their final verdict is before it is recorded.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postpone:</strong>\u00a0To put off until later.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postponement:</strong>\u00a0Permission to put off serving as a juror until a later time. A postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called for jury service. See also exemptions/excuses.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Preponderance of the evidence:</strong>\u00a0Greater weight of evidence, or evidence that is more credible and convincing. Refers to the amount of proof required to win in a civil case. It is that degree of proof that is more probable than not (lower standard than that required in criminal cases).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Propound:</strong>\u00a0To offer for discussion or consideration.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prosecutions:</strong>\u00a0Criminal legal proceedings.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prospective:</strong>\u00a0Likely to come about, relating to or effective in the future.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Reimbursement:</strong>\u00a0Specific payment for out-of-pocket expenses. For example, the court pays jurors mileage, based on the IRS standards, (one way) for travel.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Sequestration:</strong>\u00a0A sequestered jury is usually housed together at night in a hotel and prohibited from contacting people outside of the court. Sequestration rarely occurs and is meant for jurors' protection. It may be used to keep jurors away from the media during a controversial trial where widespread news coverage could influence a juror's decision. In rare cases, there may be attempts to influence the jurors' deliberation.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Source list:</strong>\u00a0The list or lists from which citizens are selected to receive a jury summons in California. Potential jurors are selected randomly from the voter registration list and the Department of Motor Vehicles' lists of drivers.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Subpoena:</strong>\u00a0A subpoena is an official order to attend court at a stated time. The most common use of the subpoena is to summon witnesses to court for the purpose of testifying in a trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Testimony:</strong>\u00a0Evidence given by a witness under oath.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Traffic Case:</strong>\u00a0Traffic cases are those in which citations have been issued for a violation of traffic laws.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unable to serve</strong>: If you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called, a postponement may be available. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unanimous:</strong>\u00a0There are 12 people on a jury trial, except when the parties in civil or misdemeanor cases agree that there may be fewer than 12. A decision is unanimous when the full jury in a criminal case or three-quarters of the jury in a civil case have agreed upon the verdict. Once a verdict has been reached, the jury is brought back into the courtroom. The verdict must be in writing, signed by the foreperson, and must be read to the jury by the court clerk or the judge.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong>\u00a0The formal decision or finding made by a jury, which has been impaneled and sworn for the trial of a case, and reported to the court.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Voir dire:</strong>\u00a0Translated from French, the legal phrase means \"to speak the truth\" or \"to see them say.\" Voir dire is the preliminary examination of prospective jurors by a judge or lawyer to decide whether that person can serve on a particular jury.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Witness:</strong>\u00a0One who can give a firsthand account of something seen, heard, or experienced.</p>\r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n   \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Glossary of Terms & Legal Dictionary"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/self-help/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/self-help/glossary.shtml"},

Within that environment, one of the most significant relationships is that between the judges and the CEO. Judges ultimately are responsible for effective administration of the court. Frequently, constitutions and statutes make this duty clear; other times, the duty is implied. In either case, effective administration takes place when the judiciary and the CEO manage the court together. Effective systems of administration provide for the participation of all judges in the development of policy and planning for the court. Through the collaborative efforts of the CEO and the presiding judge, court policy is implemented, monitored, and facilitated.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO serves the dual function of increasing the amount of time a judge has for adjudication and bringing professional management knowledge and capability to the judiciary. In courts where judges lack administrative support they must divide their time between judicial and administrative functions. With mounting caseloads and increased pressure for more case dispositions, judges have little time to direct the day-to-day operations of the court system, plan for the implementation of new technologies, or integrate new procedures that can improve system performance. A court administrator can help the court develop and recommend policies and coordinated work processes that enhance system performance, while maintaining the independence of individual judges. CEOs can also help develop goals for the courts, prepare and execute budgets, recognize changes in caseload or demographics that will affect court operations and funding, manage court personnel and programs for their professional development, improve jury systems and services to the public, implement automated information systems, plan for space requirements, administrate systems for assessing and collecting fees, and establish procedures for handling information requests.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Court Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>Personal and Professional Skill</p>\r\n                          <p>A Court Executive Officer (CEO) is selected by a process that includes a majority vote of all the judges in a multi-judge court. In very large urban courts, a selection committee chaired by the presiding judge and representative of the entire bench can select the CEO. The position of Court Executive Officer is the most important non-judicial position in the court; therefore, each judge participates in the hiring process.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO\u2019s needs to posses an ability to analyze problems, formulate recommendations, build consensus, empower people, and foster change are among the attributes of a successful administrator. A successful CEO working in a complex court environment exhibits the following:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Learning Skills: Learning to learn is basic to all other skills; court administrators are required to respond quickly, adapt to changes in technologies and workload, and enable the development of appropriate responses to organizational changes.</li>\r\n                            <li>Communication: Speaking, Writing, and Listening Skills: Most of our daily routine is taken up with communication in one form or another. As work processes and procedures are negotiated, monitored, and changed, the ability to communicate clearly is fundamental to success.</li>\r\n                            <li>Adaptability: Problem Solving and Creativity Skills: In any rapidly changing environment, successful CEOs create opportunity and exploit new technologies or create new organizational relationships to overcome barriers to court system goals.</li>\r\n                            <li>Motivation and Goal-setting Skills: The ability to link court system goals and performance measures with work processes and employee reward and staff development programs.</li>\r\n                            <li>Interpersonal Skills: The ability to relate to individuals, both within and outside the court system, through appropriate styles that communicate trust, understanding, and loyalty to court system values.</li>\r\n                            <li>Negotiation Skills: The ability to overcome conflict through problem solving and collaboration strategies that focuses on organizational goals and values as arbiters of conflict and choice.</li>\r\n                            <li>Teamwork Skills: The ability and confidence to empower court system employees and inter-organizational staff to take responsibility for court system goals and performance standards.</li>\r\n                            <li>Leadership Skills: The ability to clearly communicate organizational values that influence others to take individual responsibility for achieving court system values and goals and to instill the confidence to change and adapt as changes in work load, funding, or technology reshape existing work processes or relationships.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p>Ideally, the CEO will combine the technical skills of a manager with knowledge of public and business administration and an understanding of the duties and the problems peculiar to the courts.</p>\r\n                          <p>Specifically, the CEO should have completed considerable study of public and business administration or have on-the-job experience in these fields. To this end, many courts require that a court administrator hold a degree in business, public, or judicial administration or be a graduate of the Court Executive Development Program of the Institute for Court Management. In addition, the court administrator should be familiar with courts and government as well as with business organization and operations.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>Professional Standards</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>The Court Executive Officer should have these qualifications:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Administrative ability demonstrated by substantial experience in progressively more responsible management positions in government or the private sector;</li>\r\n                            <li>Experience in current business and management techniques, including use and implementation of automated data processing;</li>\r\n                            <li>A demonstrated ability to plan and conduct studies to improve court administration and to prepare recommendations and implement them when approved;</li>\r\n                            <li>Good judgment, understanding, and tact ability to maintain working relationships with other courts and with local, state, and federal government officials, members of the bar, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>The ability to conduct conferences and meetings and communicate clearly in writing and speech to employees, the judges of the courts, representatives of government agencies, industry, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>Formal training in court administration and managerial experience, in addition to familiarity with court procedures;</li>\r\n                            <li>Creativity, leadership, planning ability, organizational skills, initiative, decisiveness, and dedication to making productive changes in operating methods;</li>\r\n                            <li>High ethical standards;</li>\r\n                            <li>A fundamental understanding of and loyalty to the court's purpose and goals as a separate branch of government;</li>\r\n                            <li>Knowledge of and ability to adapt to the unique court environment;</li>\r\n                            <li>Ability to follow as well as to lead in the implementation of policies created by the judiciary;</li>\r\n                            <li>Respect for the requirements of confidentiality and loyalty when entrusted with the confidence of the judges;</li>\r\n                            <li>Educational qualifications related directly to the functions that the CEO's position requires.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A graduate degree in judicial administration, public administration, business administration, or law with management training or experience in a court for three or more years with proven competency in administration and management.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A bachelor's degree in one of the fields named above or three years of experience in a responsible elected or appointed position, with training in court administration.                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Court Reporter</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n\r\n                                  What Does a Court Reporter Do?\r\n                                  <p>A court reporter, officially known as a certified shorthand reporter, must record everything that is said during official court proceedings.

The Interim Court Executive Officer, Cindia Martinez.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>What Does A Judge Do?</strong></p>\r\n                                  <p>When criminal charges are filed by a prosecutor or a civil lawsuit is filed by a litigant, the case is assigned to a courtroom. It is the job of the judge in that courtroom to be in charge of everything that happens to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In every case, the judge must be impartial. That means the judge must be able to be fair to everyone involved in the case. They are called the parties. If the judge thinks there is any reason for the parties to question whether the judge can be fair, the judge must tell the parties about this reason. If there is any reason that the judge might not be able to be impartial, such as the judge is a friend of one of the parties, the judge must withdraw from the case. That is called a recusal.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a criminal case, the judge schedules an arraignment, at which time the charges that have been filed are explained to the defendant. The defendant may admit to the charges and plead guilty, or the defendant may ask for a trial. There might be a settlement of the case with a plea agreement, also called a plea bargain, in which the prosecutor recommends that the judge impose a sentence that is less than the maximum possible sentence in exchange for the defendant's plea of guilty to the charges; or the defendant might agree to plead guilty to a less serious charge. If case is not settled, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a civil case, the judge will usually meet with the lawyers to see if the case can be resolved or settled without having a trial. In a civil case, the settlement usually involves the payment of money in exchange for voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. If the civil case cannot be settled between the parties, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A party may request that the judge make legal rulings about the case before the trial by filing a motion. To make any rulings on a case, the judge must understand the facts and know the laws that apply to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A trial is the time when the parties present evidence to prove their case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must present the evidence to prove the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. In a civil case, the person who filed the case must present the evidence to prove the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>If a trial is held, the judge is responsible for:</p>\r\n                                  <ul>\r\n                                    <li>Setting the hours of the trial;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Keeping order in the courtroom;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Presiding over the selection of jurors;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Permitting the presentation of evidence through testimony of witnesses or the introduction of exhibits;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Deciding on what evidence can be considered by the jurors in making their decision;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Explaining the law that applies to the case to the jurors so they can deliberate, and</li>\r\n                                    <li>Sentencing the defendant if the defendant is found guilty in a criminal case.</li>\r\n                                  </ul>\r\n                                  <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Judge?</strong></p>\r\n                                  <p>There are two ways to become a judge in California. One is to be appointed by the Governor. The other is to run for election.</p>\r\n                                  <p>Qualifications include:</p>\r\n                                  <ul>\r\n                                    <li>Being a lawyer and a member of the State Bar of California.</li>\r\n                                    <li>Superior Court judges must have at least 10 years of experience.</li>\r\n                                    <li>A lawyer who seeks an appointment from the Governor must fill out an application. The Governor's staff reviews the application. Most successful candidates also submit letters of support from friends, including other lawyers, judges, law school professors, and others who know about the candidate\u2019s qualifications.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the Governor\u2019s office thinks the applicant has sufficient merit, the State Bar of California Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation is asked to review the candidate's application. The commission solicits additional information and recommendations from other lawyers and judges who know the applicant.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the applicant receives a high rating, the Governor\u2019s staff will submit the application to the Governor, who then decides whether to grant the appointment.</li>\r\n                                    <li>A lawyer may also seek a judicial appointment by running for election. They may run against a current judge, or they may run for an open office.</li>\r\n                                    <li>Candidates for judicial election are usually evaluated by a committee of the local bar association. The bar association will rate the candidate and inform the voters before the election.</li>\r\n                                    <li>The term of office for a trial judge in California is six years.</li>\r\n                                  </ul>\r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div><div class=\"trigger2\">Lawyer</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <p><strong>What Does A Lawyer Do?</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>Lawyers operate in a wide variety of capacities such as providing legal counsel to governments, corporations and to individuals in a wide variety of situations. In a courtroom, however, the lawyer\u2019s role is narrowed to a more specific purpose.</p>\r\n                          <p>Generally, there are two sides in a courtroom proceeding. One side, called the plaintiff, who is seeking a remedy for an injury or to a violation of rights. The plaintiff is also called the complainant. A plaintiff can be government, a corporation, a group of people or a single individual.</p>\r\n                          <p>The other side is the defendant, who is accused of causing an injury or of violating the plaintiff\u2019s rights. The defendant is also called the respondent.</p>\r\n                          <p>A plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, who is also called an attorney, works for the plaintiff and explains to a judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened. The attorney for the plaintiff wants the judge to find that what happened was not legal and that something should be done to fix it.</p>\r\n                          <p>A defendant\u2019s attorney, who works for the defendant, also explains to the judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened. The attorney for the defendant wants the judge to find that what happened was legal.

The functions of the office are defined by the county charter and by California state law. The attorneys and other staff employed by the office render legal services to individuals who are accused of public offenses, and who cannot afford to retain the services of a private attorney. They also represent any person under the age of 18 who is facing juvenile delinquency proceedings, or regarding whom the state has instituted wardship proceedings because of habitual truancy or incorrigibility. The public defender represents individuals who are involuntarily detained in medical facilities in a variety of mental health proceedings because of purported mental disabilities, those as to whom conservatorship proceedings have been instituted because they are alleged to be gravely disabled, and patients whose competency to refuse medical treatment is challenged. Finally, the public defender's office represents individuals who are subject to contempt proceedings for violation of court orders, such as child support and child visitation or custody orders. (More detail regarding the functions can be found in the frequently asked questions.)</p>\r\n                          <p>The attorney\u2019s role in the public defender's office is identical to that of a privately retained attorney.

There is a filing fee. Once you have the financial information needed, you may file a \"Writ of Execution\". There is a fee for issuance of a Writ of Execution. A Writ of Execution is a court paper, which tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to pay your claim. The kinds of property an officer may be able to take: wages, bank accounts, automobiles, and business property or rental income. The Sheriff will charge a fee to execute the writ. If the debtor owns property you may want to record an abstract to place a lien so that you will be able to be paid if the property is purchased, sold or financed. There is an issuance fee. The abstract is recorded with the County Recorder in the county where the property is located. The Recorder will charge a fee to have the abstract recorded.<a href=\"../forms-filing/docs/copy-and-forms-fee.pdf\"> Download a printable civil filing\u00a0and appearance fees list</a></li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: I won my small claims case and the judgment debtor has paid me in full.

Please carefully read your courtesy notice in its entirety. You may attend a traffic school in person or by computer.

Code, \u00a7 40610)\" portion of your Notice to Appear. Upon correction of the violation, have a law enforcement officer or an authorized inspection/installation station agent sign the reverse of your ticket in the \"Certificate of Correction\" section. Registration and driver's license violations may also be corrected at an office of the California DMV by any clerk or deputy of a court. The violation will be dismissed by the court after proof of correction and payment of transaction fee are presented to the court by mail or in person by the appearance date.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: What if I disagree with the ticket the officer wrote, what can I do?</strong></p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li><strong>A:\u00a0</strong>You have three options available to you, if the citation is an infraction that does not require a mandatory court appearance:\r\n                          <ol>\r\n                                  <li><p>You can post the bail amount and request a trial by written declaration. The trial by written declaration form is available in the clerk\u2019s office or you may request a form be mailed to you. The trial by declaration is a method of contesting your case without making a court appearance. You and the officer will each submit a written statement of the facts of the case. A judge or commissioner will review the declarations and make a decision on the case.</p></li>\r\n                                <li>You can request a court trial by mail or in person.

However, most tickets can be taken care of without appearing in court merely by paying the bail amount due on or before your court appearance date. By paying the bail amount without appearing in court, you will be convicted of the violation and the violation may appear on your record at the DMV. A point may be charged to your DMV record (depending on the violation) and your insurance may be adversely affected.<br>\r\n                              <br>\r\n                            If you fail to pay the bail or appear in court, you may be charged with a failure to appear. You may be arrested and punished by six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine regardless of the disposition of the original charge (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40508). In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided may be deemed to have elected a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. Your driver's license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1214.1).</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                      <p><strong>Q: Can I make payments on my ticket?</strong></p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li><strong>A:\u00a0</strong>Yes. The clerk's office has the authority to set up payments. You will be assessed an administrative fee for this service. You will be required to sign a contract agreeing to the payment schedule. This is the same arrangement that will be received by an individual who is placed on calendar to request payments. The clerk's office will be able to quickly process your case for payments without the need to spend the entire afternoon in court to achieve the same result. <a href=\"../forms-filing/docs/copy-and-forms-fee.pdf\">Download a printable civil filing\u00a0and appearance fees list</a></li>\r\n                          </ul> \r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n              \t\t\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        <!--- End Accordion --->                \r\n                                        \r\n        </div>\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>"], "title": ["Frequently Asked Questions"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/self-help/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "http://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/self-help/faq.shtml"},

There are three levels of severity of traffic violations: infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. Most traffic violations are infractions, but some, like vehicular manslaughter, are felonies. </p>\r\n          <p>Infractions are not punishable by jail or prison and are not subject to trial by jury; the punishment is a fine. Penalties for infractions can be as much as $200 or more for common traffic infractions including speeding, running a red light or stop sign.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Misdemeanors, such as driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, can carry penalties of as much as $2,000 or more and/or confinement in a city or county jail. The maximum penalty allowed in California for a misdemeanor is one year in county jail and/or a fine.\r\n            Felonies are punishable by formal probation or formal confinement in state prison. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infractions </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common infractions are moving violations without injury, such as speeding and running a red light. Drivers stopped for moving violations are usually released after they sign a Notice to Appear, printed on the ticket, agreeing to appear at a set date and time. The traffic ticket provides information about when to appear in court. Drivers charged with an infraction that want to admit guilt can avoid a court appearance by paying the fine in person or by mail. If drivers do not appear or pay the traffic fine within the authorized time, their driver?s license may be suspended. Usually they will not be able to renew their vehicle registration until they have paid all outstanding parking tickets and administrative costs in full. Drivers who plead not guilty and request a trial may be required to post bail or sign a written document to appear in court. If they fail to appear, they may be charged with the additional misdemeanor of violating their agreement to appear. In this case, a warrant may be issued for their arrest and their driving privilege may also be suspended. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Misdemeanors </h2>\r\n          <p>The most common misdemeanors are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and driving without a valid license. In some cases, drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be taken into custody. Drivers charged with almost all other traffic misdemeanors and infractions usually will not be taken into custody but will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear in court. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Infraction Trials </h2>\r\n          <p>If a driver has been charged with a traffic violation they do not have the right to trial by a jury. The defendant may offer opposing evidence, argue the law, present supporting witnesses and other evidence, and cross-examine the law enforcement officer who issued the citation. </p>\r\n          <p>If a driver is judged \"not guilty,\" the bail will be refunded if previously posted. Drivers judged \"guilty\" must pay the fine or, in a serious misdemeanor, serve the sentence. People who willfully do not pay the fine and/or do not serve the sentence within the time authorized may be charged with contempt of court or failure to pay a fine, in which case court collections unit will begin to pursue the court-ordered debt from the individual. </p>\r\n          <h2>Driving Under the Influence </h2>\r\n          <p>The penalties for driving under the influence vary depending on the number of a driver's prior convictions for this offense.</p>\r\n          <p>A first-time violation can be punished by a jail term of not more than six months, a fine and penalty ranging from $1,000 to $2,700, and suspension or restriction of driving privileges for six months. Drivers with three DUI convictions within seven years normally receive jail terms of not less than 120 days nor more than one-year and a fine and penalty of not less than $1,053, and no more than $2,700. The person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be revoked for three years. </p>\r\n          <p>Drivers charged with a DUI must appear in court for an arraignment and may be requested to post bail. Bail can vary from $300 to $15,000. Whenever the possible sentences include jail time, the court, upon request, will appoint an attorney for drivers who cannot afford to hire one. </p>\r\n          <h2>How Parking Violations Are Settled </h2>\r\n          <p>Since July 1, 1993, legislation transferred the adjudication (settling) of parking tickets from the courts to the issuing agencies.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <p>Only cases that are appealed because they cannot be settled after hearings with the issuing agency will come to the court.\u00a0 </p>\r\n          <h2>Mandatory Automobile Insurance Law </h2>\r\n          <p>Under the mandatory insurance law, all drivers must carry evidence of financial responsibility and must provide that evidence to an officer on request. A driver who fails to provide proof of insurance on request by an officer during a traffic stop is guilty of an infraction.</p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant claims an inability to pay both the insurance and the fine or other financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to make installment payments or to pay the entire amount within a specified time. If you request installment payments, an additional $35.00 will be charged to your account.The court may reduce or waive the fine based on a defendant's inability to pay, but the Legislature specifically declared that it is in the interest of justice that the minimum fines for violations be enforced. In a case of extreme financial hardship, the court may allow the defendant to substitute community service in place of payment of the fine. </p>\r\n          <p>If the defendant fails to pay the fine (or complete community service), the court may issue a warrant for the separate offense of failure to pay or obey a court order, may assess civil assessments, may impose additional fines, and may suspend the defendant's driving privileges. </p>\r\n          <h2>Traffic Tickets </h2>\r\n          <p>If you are charged with a traffic misdemeanor or infraction, you usually will not be taken into custody. Instead, you will be asked to sign a Notice to Appear, often called a \"citation\" or a \"ticket.\" You may be taken into custody if you refuse to sign the citation; the arresting law enforcement officer also signs it. Your signature does not mean that you are admitting guilt. It only means that you promise to appear in court at a date and time specified either on the front of the Notice to Appear or in the courtesy notice that may be mailed by the court to the address on the citation. The court appearance will usually be a minimum of 21 days after the ticket is issued. </p>\r\n          <p>General traffic information please call the Clerk\u2019s Office at <a href=\"tel:530-934-6446\">530-934-6446</a>. </p>\r\n          <p>Payments on delinquent traffic ticket fines contact the collection agency. </p>\r\n          <h2>California Rules of Court, Rules 4.106 and 4.335 </h2>\r\n          <p>You have the right to petition the Court to reduce or vacate the civil assessment or for a judicial officer to determine if you have the ability to pay your fine. </p>\r\n          <h2>Reduce or Vacate Civil Assessment</h2>\r\n          <p>You must ask the Court, in writing, for a review of your circumstances. You have the option to ask the Court to make a determination based on your declaration and supporting documents or request to appear before a judicial officer to be heard.

In other words, the plaintiff has no right of appeal. So if you should lose, that's probably the end of the case. However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again. </p>\r\n          <p>If you are the plaintiff and a Claim of Defendant is filed (the defendant sues you on the same case) and you have a judgment against you, you may file an appeal on that decision. </p>\r\n          <h2>Small Claims Advisor </h2>\r\n          <p>The Self-Help Center has all of the small claim forms and is able to assist you with filling out the forms. </p>\r\n          <h2>Filing Your Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>Go to the court closest to you and obtain a small claims packet for filing your case. </p>\r\n          <h2>Monetary Limits </h2>\r\n          <p>The Small Claims court has a monetary limit, called a jurisdictional limit, on the amount of money damages that a person can claim.

See the other helpful web sites listed below for information on filing a claim. </p>\r\n          <h2> Web Site to Help You File a Claim </h2>\r\n          <p>The California Courts\u2019 web site [http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm] has a section full of information needed to go through the process of a small claims suit, including an overview, forms, rules, tips, and much more. </p>\r\n          <h2>What to Expect in Court </h2>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Come to court organized and prepared.</li>\r\n            <li>Arrive promptly at your assigned court time; if you arrive late, your case may be heard without you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring enough photocopies of all your evidence for each party and the judge. </li>\r\n            <li>Any copies submitted to the judge the day of trial may not be returned to you. </li>\r\n            <li>Bring all your witnesses. </li>\r\n            <li>If both parties are present, meaning both the plaintiff and the defendant, you will be asked to go into the hallway to exchange and review any documents that will be submitted to the judge as evidence. This must be done prior to the case being heard. </li>\r\n            <li>Have all your documents ready and in chronological order when your case is called. </li>\r\n            <li>There will be several other cases assigned to the same time as yours so you may have to wait to have your case heard. </li>\r\n            <li>You may be asked to sign a stipulation allowing a pro-tem judge (temporary judge) to hear your case. If you do not wish to have a temporary judge hear your case, your case may be continued to a date when there is a commissioner or judge of the Superior Court to hear your case. </li>\r\n            <li>You may decline a temporary judge when you file your claim and avoid a continuance to another date. </li>\r\n            <li>When your case is called, you will stand at a podium in front of the superior court judge or a pro-tem judge. You will be asked to present your evidence and give your testimony. Always address the judge and not the other party.\r\n              Usually, the plaintiff will give his/her testimony first and then the defendant.</li>\r\n            <li>The judge will probably ask questions to further his/her understanding of the case. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are the only party to appear at the trial and you are the plaintiff, you still must prove your case. Do not expect to \"automatically\" win your case if the other party does not appear. </li>\r\n            <li>The proceedings will not be recorded by a court reporter or by any other type of recording. </li>\r\n            <li>If you are not fluent in the English language, you must bring an interpreter with you. Small Claims courts do not provide interpreters. </li>\r\n            <li> The judge will usually not tell you the decision in court. The decision (judgment) will be mailed to you. </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h2>If You Are The Defendant</h2>\r\n          <p>If you have been named as a defendant in a Small Claims action and have received an order to appear at a Small Claims hearing, this means that you are being sued. If you don't know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately for an explanation. </p>\r\n          <p>Never ignore an order to appear in court even if you think the case is wrong, unfair, or has no basis. If you do not appear in court at the proper time and date, the court may still hear and decide the case without you and you may lose the suit by default. </p>\r\n          <p>If you believe the plaintiff has caused you injury or owes you money for any reason, you can file a claim against the plaintiff in the same Small Claims court action. If your case is related to the subject of the plaintiff's case, it may be helpful and convenient to resolve it at the same hearing by filing a Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff. </p>\r\n          <p>If judgment has been entered against you and the appeal time has lapsed, your money or property and maybe a portion of your earnings can then be taken legally by the judgment creditor to pay the judgment against you. A Small Claims judgment is public record. Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, these agencies come to the court often and place the judgment on the losing party's credit record even after the judgment is paid.</p>\r\n          <p>Visit our <a href=\"/self-help/faq.shtml\">FAQ page</a> for more information. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n            \r\n            <!-- Start SubContent -->\r\n          <!-- End SubContent -->\r\n   \r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "title": ["Small Claims"], "_template": "2d64-490e-80a3", "parent": ["https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/index.shtml"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.glenncourt.ca.gov/divisions/small-claims.shtml"},

For cases tried in a general (superior level) jurisdiction (general civil, family law, probate, juvenile, felony), the court of appeal is the Third District Court of Appeals.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Ascertained:</strong>\u00a0Determined; proved to be true.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Bailiff:</strong>\u00a0An officer from the sheriff's department who maintains courtroom order and jury custody.

If a lawyer wishes to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" for that juror. Challenges, or reasons to dismiss a juror, are of two kinds:</p>\r\n      \t\t        <blockquote>\r\n      \t\t          <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"522\">\r\n      \t\t            <tbody>\r\n      \t\t              <tr>\r\n      \t\t                <td valign=\"top\" width=\"105\"><strong>a.

It frequently happens that a prospective juror will be excused in a certain case and later accepted in another.

It establishes the character and organization of America's sovereign power and the manner of its exercise.

A criminal case is an action brought by the government against a person who has broken the law. Criminal cases are separated into three main categories; felony, misdemeanors, and infractions</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Degree of proof:</strong>\u00a0The amount of proof necessary to prove a case. In a criminal case, such proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Deliberations:</strong>\u00a0This occurs after a trial when a jury goes into its assigned private room to think about and discuss evidence and testimony to help it reach a verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Directed verdict:</strong>\u00a0After evidence has been presented and if no issue of fact remains for the jury to determine, the judge will tell the jury what verdict to return. The jury must return that verdict.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Disqualification (juror)</strong>: The condition of having been rendered not qualified to serve.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Eligible/eligibility ( for jury duty):</strong>\u00a0Every person who is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the respective county, able to understand the English language, not currently serving on any other jury, and who has not been convicted of a felony is eligible to serve as a juror (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 203).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong>\u00a0Any type of legal proof presented at trial through witnesses, records, and/or exhibits.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exemptions/excuses/postponements (for jury service):</strong>\u00a0By law, no one who meets the basic criteria is automatically exempt from service. The law does provide for hardship excuses. Hardship is defined by law and includes no reasonable transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, physical or mental impairment for those over age 70, public health and safety, or no alternate care for another. If you believe you fall in any of these categories, contact your local jury office. Postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong>\u00a0Document or material object produced and identified in court as evidence in a case. Each of these documents or objects is ordinarily given an identifying letter or number in alphabetical or numerical sequence when it is offered as evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Felon:</strong>\u00a0A person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Foreperson:</strong>\u00a0Often called the \"presiding juror.\" At the beginning of deliberations, the jury votes to select one of its members to be the foreperson. The jury foreperson's duty is to preside and see that discussion during deliberations is carried on in a free and orderly manner, that the case and issues are fully and freely discussed, and that every juror is given a chance to participate in the discussion. As the deliberations conclude, the foreperson counts the votes and completes and signs the verdict form.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Impartial:</strong>\u00a0Without bias, prejudice, or other preconception. The members of a jury should have no opinion about or vested interest in a case at the start of the trial and should base their verdict only on competent legal evidence presented during the trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong>\u00a0The guidelines given by the judge at the beginning and end of a trial that explain what the law in the case is and how the jurors should evaluate the evidence.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury pool:</strong>\u00a0The group of prospective qualified jurors appearing for assignment to trial jury panels.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury summons:</strong>\u00a0The papers sent to potential jurors that require their attendance in court for possible service on a jury. California courts summon jurors to the courthouse no more than once in any given 12-month period.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Jury selection:</strong>\u00a0The process by which jurors for a particular trial are selected from the larger group of potential jurors summoned to the courthouse. Once the jurors arrive in the courtroom, the judge and lawyers ask the jurors questions for the purpose of determining whether jurors are free of bias, or prejudice, or anything might interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Juvenile Case:</strong>\u00a0Juvenile cases are those involving minors under the age of 18 years. These are separated into two main categories--Juvenile Delinquency for minors who have broken the law and Juvenile Dependency for minors who have been removed from the home and/or care of their parents or guardians.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Litigants:</strong>\u00a0Any persons or groups engaged in a lawsuit.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>One-day/one-trial:</strong>\u00a0California courts have adopted the one-day or one-trial system. One day or one trial means that prospective jurors have to come to the court only once. If you are not chosen for a trial, then your term of service is complete for one year. If you do serve on a jury, you will not be required to report for jury service for at least another 12 months.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Pending:</strong>\u00a0In process; not yet decided.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Perjury:</strong>\u00a0A false statement made willfully and knowingly while under oath in a court proceeding.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Polled/polling:</strong>\u00a0Calling the names of the jurors and having them state what their final verdict is before it is recorded.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postpone:</strong>\u00a0To put off until later.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Postponement:</strong>\u00a0Permission to put off serving as a juror until a later time. A postponement may be available if you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called for jury service. See also exemptions/excuses.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Preponderance of the evidence:</strong>\u00a0Greater weight of evidence, or evidence that is more credible and convincing. Refers to the amount of proof required to win in a civil case. It is that degree of proof that is more probable than not (lower standard than that required in criminal cases).</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Propound:</strong>\u00a0To offer for discussion or consideration.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prosecutions:</strong>\u00a0Criminal legal proceedings.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Prospective:</strong>\u00a0Likely to come about, relating to or effective in the future.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Reimbursement:</strong>\u00a0Specific payment for out-of-pocket expenses. For example, the court pays jurors mileage, based on the IRS standards, (one way) for travel.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Sequestration:</strong>\u00a0A sequestered jury is usually housed together at night in a hotel and prohibited from contacting people outside of the court. Sequestration rarely occurs and is meant for jurors' protection. It may be used to keep jurors away from the media during a controversial trial where widespread news coverage could influence a juror's decision. In rare cases, there may be attempts to influence the jurors' deliberation.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Source list:</strong>\u00a0The list or lists from which citizens are selected to receive a jury summons in California. Potential jurors are selected randomly from the voter registration list and the Department of Motor Vehicles' lists of drivers.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Subpoena:</strong>\u00a0A subpoena is an official order to attend court at a stated time. The most common use of the subpoena is to summon witnesses to court for the purpose of testifying in a trial.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Testimony:</strong>\u00a0Evidence given by a witness under oath.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Traffic Case:</strong>\u00a0Traffic cases are those in which citations have been issued for a violation of traffic laws.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unable to serve</strong>: If you have health problems, a paid vacation, or other personal commitments that cannot be rescheduled at the time you are initially called, a postponement may be available. If you have already received one postponement during the past 12 months, you will probably have to come to court and speak to a judge to further delay your service.</p>\r\n      \t\t        <p><strong>Unanimous:</strong>\u00a0There are 12 people on a jury trial, except when the parties in civil or misdemeanor cases agree that there may be fewer than 12. A decision is unanimous when the full jury in a criminal case or three-quarters of the jury in a civil case have agreed upon the verdict. Once a verdict has been reached, the jury is brought back into the courtroom.

Within that environment, one of the most significant relationships is that between the judges and the CEO. Judges ultimately are responsible for effective administration of the court. Frequently, constitutions and statutes make this duty clear; other times, the duty is implied. In either case, effective administration takes place when the judiciary and the CEO manage the court together. Effective systems of administration provide for the participation of all judges in the development of policy and planning for the court. Through the collaborative efforts of the CEO and the presiding judge, court policy is implemented, monitored, and facilitated.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO serves the dual function of increasing the amount of time a judge has for adjudication and bringing professional management knowledge and capability to the judiciary. In courts where judges lack administrative support they must divide their time between judicial and administrative functions. With mounting caseloads and increased pressure for more case dispositions, judges have little time to direct the day-to-day operations of the court system, plan for the implementation of new technologies, or integrate new procedures that can improve system performance. A court administrator can help the court develop and recommend policies and coordinated work processes that enhance system performance, while maintaining the independence of individual judges. CEOs can also help develop goals for the courts, prepare and execute budgets, recognize changes in caseload or demographics that will affect court operations and funding, manage court personnel and programs for their professional development, improve jury systems and services to the public, implement automated information systems, plan for space requirements, administrate systems for assessing and collecting fees, and establish procedures for handling information requests.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Court Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>Personal and Professional Skill</p>\r\n                          <p>A Court Executive Officer (CEO) is selected by a process that includes a majority vote of all the judges in a multi-judge court. In very large urban courts, a selection committee chaired by the presiding judge and representative of the entire bench can select the CEO. The position of Court Executive Officer is the most important non-judicial position in the court; therefore, each judge participates in the hiring process.</p>\r\n                          <p>The CEO\u2019s needs to posses an ability to analyze problems, formulate recommendations, build consensus, empower people, and foster change are among the attributes of a successful administrator. A successful CEO working in a complex court environment exhibits the following:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Learning Skills: Learning to learn is basic to all other skills; court administrators are required to respond quickly, adapt to changes in technologies and workload, and enable the development of appropriate responses to organizational changes.</li>\r\n                            <li>Communication: Speaking, Writing, and Listening Skills: Most of our daily routine is taken up with communication in one form or another. As work processes and procedures are negotiated, monitored, and changed, the ability to communicate clearly is fundamental to success.</li>\r\n                            <li>Adaptability: Problem Solving and Creativity Skills: In any rapidly changing environment, successful CEOs create opportunity and exploit new technologies or create new organizational relationships to overcome barriers to court system goals.</li>\r\n                            <li>Motivation and Goal-setting Skills: The ability to link court system goals and performance measures with work processes and employee reward and staff development programs.</li>\r\n                            <li>Interpersonal Skills: The ability to relate to individuals, both within and outside the court system, through appropriate styles that communicate trust, understanding, and loyalty to court system values.</li>\r\n                            <li>Negotiation Skills: The ability to overcome conflict through problem solving and collaboration strategies that focuses on organizational goals and values as arbiters of conflict and choice.</li>\r\n                            <li>Teamwork Skills: The ability and confidence to empower court system employees and inter-organizational staff to take responsibility for court system goals and performance standards.</li>\r\n                            <li>Leadership Skills: The ability to clearly communicate organizational values that influence others to take individual responsibility for achieving court system values and goals and to instill the confidence to change and adapt as changes in work load, funding, or technology reshape existing work processes or relationships.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p>Ideally, the CEO will combine the technical skills of a manager with knowledge of public and business administration and an understanding of the duties and the problems peculiar to the courts.</p>\r\n                          <p>Specifically, the CEO should have completed considerable study of public and business administration or have on-the-job experience in these fields. To this end, many courts require that a court administrator hold a degree in business, public, or judicial administration or be a graduate of the Court Executive Development Program of the Institute for Court Management. In addition, the court administrator should be familiar with courts and government as well as with business organization and operations.</p>\r\n                          <p><strong>Professional Standards</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>The Court Executive Officer should have these qualifications:</p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li>Administrative ability demonstrated by substantial experience in progressively more responsible management positions in government or the private sector;</li>\r\n                            <li>Experience in current business and management techniques, including use and implementation of automated data processing;</li>\r\n                            <li>A demonstrated ability to plan and conduct studies to improve court administration and to prepare recommendations and implement them when approved;</li>\r\n                            <li>Good judgment, understanding, and tact ability to maintain working relationships with other courts and with local, state, and federal government officials, members of the bar, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>The ability to conduct conferences and meetings and communicate clearly in writing and speech to employees, the judges of the courts, representatives of government agencies, industry, and the public;</li>\r\n                            <li>Formal training in court administration and managerial experience, in addition to familiarity with court procedures;</li>\r\n                            <li>Creativity, leadership, planning ability, organizational skills, initiative, decisiveness, and dedication to making productive changes in operating methods;</li>\r\n                            <li>High ethical standards;</li>\r\n                            <li>A fundamental understanding of and loyalty to the court's purpose and goals as a separate branch of government;</li>\r\n                            <li>Knowledge of and ability to adapt to the unique court environment;</li>\r\n                            <li>Ability to follow as well as to lead in the implementation of policies created by the judiciary;</li>\r\n                            <li>Respect for the requirements of confidentiality and loyalty when entrusted with the confidence of the judges;</li>\r\n                            <li>Educational qualifications related directly to the functions that the CEO's position requires.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A graduate degree in judicial administration, public administration, business administration, or law with management training or experience in a court for three or more years with proven competency in administration and management.</p>\r\n                      <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n                          <p>A bachelor's degree in one of the fields named above or three years of experience in a responsible elected or appointed position, with training in court administration.                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n           \t  </div>\r\n              \t\t<div class=\"trigger2\">Court Reporter</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n\r\n                                  What Does a Court Reporter Do?\r\n                                  <p>A court reporter, officially known as a certified shorthand reporter, must record everything that is said during official court proceedings.

It is the job of the judge in that courtroom to be in charge of everything that happens to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In every case, the judge must be impartial. That means the judge must be able to be fair to everyone involved in the case. They are called the parties. If the judge thinks there is any reason for the parties to question whether the judge can be fair, the judge must tell the parties about this reason. If there is any reason that the judge might not be able to be impartial, such as the judge is a friend of one of the parties, the judge must withdraw from the case. That is called a recusal.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a criminal case, the judge schedules an arraignment, at which time the charges that have been filed are explained to the defendant. The defendant may admit to the charges and plead guilty, or the defendant may ask for a trial. There might be a settlement of the case with a plea agreement, also called a plea bargain, in which the prosecutor recommends that the judge impose a sentence that is less than the maximum possible sentence in exchange for the defendant's plea of guilty to the charges; or the defendant might agree to plead guilty to a less serious charge. If case is not settled, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>In a civil case, the judge will usually meet with the lawyers to see if the case can be resolved or settled without having a trial. In a civil case, the settlement usually involves the payment of money in exchange for voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. If the civil case cannot be settled between the parties, it will be set for trial.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A party may request that the judge make legal rulings about the case before the trial by filing a motion. To make any rulings on a case, the judge must understand the facts and know the laws that apply to the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>A trial is the time when the parties present evidence to prove their case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must present the evidence to prove the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. In a civil case, the person who filed the case must present the evidence to prove the case.</p>\r\n                                  <p>If a trial is held, the judge is responsible for:</p>\r\n                                  <ul>\r\n                                    <li>Setting the hours of the trial;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Keeping order in the courtroom;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Presiding over the selection of jurors;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Permitting the presentation of evidence through testimony of witnesses or the introduction of exhibits;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Deciding on what evidence can be considered by the jurors in making their decision;</li>\r\n                                    <li>Explaining the law that applies to the case to the jurors so they can deliberate, and</li>\r\n                                    <li>Sentencing the defendant if the defendant is found guilty in a criminal case.</li>\r\n                                  </ul>\r\n                                  <p><strong>How Does Someone Become A Judge?</strong></p>\r\n                                  <p>There are two ways to become a judge in California.

The Governor's staff reviews the application. Most successful candidates also submit letters of support from friends, including other lawyers, judges, law school professors, and others who know about the candidate\u2019s qualifications.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the Governor\u2019s office thinks the applicant has sufficient merit, the State Bar of California Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation is asked to review the candidate's application. The commission solicits additional information and recommendations from other lawyers and judges who know the applicant.</li>\r\n                                    <li>If the applicant receives a high rating, the Governor\u2019s staff will submit the application to the Governor, who then decides whether to grant the appointment.</li>\r\n                                    <li>A lawyer may also seek a judicial appointment by running for election.

In a courtroom, however, the lawyer\u2019s role is narrowed to a more specific purpose.</p>\r\n                          <p>Generally, there are two sides in a courtroom proceeding.

The functions of the office are defined by the county charter and by California state law. The attorneys and other staff employed by the office render legal services to individuals who are accused of public offenses, and who cannot afford to retain the services of a private attorney. They also represent any person under the age of 18 who is facing juvenile delinquency proceedings, or regarding whom the state has instituted wardship proceedings because of habitual truancy or incorrigibility. The public defender represents individuals who are involuntarily detained in medical facilities in a variety of mental health proceedings because of purported mental disabilities, those as to whom conservatorship proceedings have been instituted because they are alleged to be gravely disabled, and patients whose competency to refuse medical treatment is challenged. Finally, the public defender's office represents individuals who are subject to contempt proceedings for violation of court orders, such as child support and child visitation or custody orders.

You can be called for jury duty every other year; however, this usually does not occur.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: Will I receive compensation for appearing as a juror?</strong></p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0All jurors who appear, whether selected to sit on a jury panel or excused, will receive $15 per day starting with the second day of service as juror fees plus round trip mileage at the rate as authorized by the Internal Revenue Service. You are entitled to mileage to the courthouse for the first day of service. If you are excused on the first day, you may obtain your mileage from the Clerk\u2019s Office. The fee must be collected on the day of service or will be deemed waived. You can obtain a juror attendance verification for your employer from the Clerk\u2019s Office. If you are a government employee (federal, state, county, and city), you will need to obtain a verification form for each day you are present. Your employer will pay your day\u2019s wages when you give them your jury payment and verification form. Juror payroll is processed at the completion of the trial. Your check should arrive in approximately two weeks.</li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: What if I wish to be deferred due to a hardship?</strong></p>\r\n                          <ul>\r\n                            <li><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0On the day you are summoned, the judge will inform the group of the expected length of the trial.

Ask your mediator how it works in your court. Please remember that no matter how sensitive or understanding a judge or commissioner may be, that person does not know your children the way you do.

If you do not have information regarding the judgment debtor\u2019s income or property, you may make the debtor come to court to answer questions. This is done by filing an Order of Examination. There is a filing fee. Once you have the financial information needed, you may file a \"Writ of Execution\". There is a fee for issuance of a Writ of Execution. A Writ of Execution is a court paper, which tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to pay your claim. The kinds of property an officer may be able to take: wages, bank accounts, automobiles, and business property or rental income. The Sheriff will charge a fee to execute the writ. If the debtor owns property you may want to record an abstract to place a lien so that you will be able to be paid if the property is purchased, sold or financed. There is an issuance fee. The abstract is recorded with the County Recorder in the county where the property is located. The Recorder will charge a fee to have the abstract recorded.<a href=\"../forms-filing/docs/copy-and-forms-fee.pdf\"> Download a printable civil filing\u00a0and appearance fees list</a></li>\r\n                          </ul>\r\n                          <p><strong>Q: I won my small claims case and the judgment debtor has paid me in full.

In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided may be deemed to have elected a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. Your driver's license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency (Pen.
