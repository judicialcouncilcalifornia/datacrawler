However, it is not mandatory they do so.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"7\">Do I have to register to use eFileCA?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, all users must register with an electronic filing service provider (EFSP)\u00a0 prior to using e-filing.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"8\">Is support available for the eFileCA system?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, support is provided for both attorneys and self-represented litigants. Each electronic filing service provider (EFSP) offers a different type of e-filing support. When you pick your EFSP, look at the level of filing support that is offered and see if it meets your needs.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"9\">Is training available for using eFileCA?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, training is provided for free. You can register by selecting Web Training Sessions at <a href=\"https://california.tylerhost.net/OFSWEB\">https://california.tylerhost.net/OFSWEB</a>\u00a0 or contact your electronic filing service provider (EFSP). You can attend as many training sessions as you need. One hour of CLE credit can be earned for many of the sessions.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"10\">What time do I have to submit my document to have it deemed filed the same day?</h3><div><p></p><p>In accordance with Rule 2.253(b)(6), any document received electronically by the court between 12:00am and 11:59:59pm on a court day shall be deemed filed on that court day. Any document that is received electronically on a non-court day shall be deemed filed on the next court day. The effective date of filing any document received electronically is prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. This provision concerns only the effective date of filing. Any document that is received electronically must be processed and satisfy all other legal filing requirements to be filed as an official court record.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"11\">What documents can and cannot be e-filed?</h3><div><p></p><p>All documents can be electronically filed except for those outlined in Sutter County Superior Court Local\u00a0 Rule 2.2.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"12\">What if my filing is rejected?</h3><div><p></p><p>You will be notified by the EFSP of the rejection, and of the reasons for the rejection.\u00a0 It is then your responsibility to correct and re-submit the filing.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"13\">What is e-service?</h3><div><p></p><p>E-service is a feature provided by eFileCA where documents are electronically served to other parties in a case via e-mail. Using this option, you can track when each party received and opened the filing.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"14\">How do I serve other individuals with my e-filed documents?</h3><div><p></p><p>Filers are responsible for accomplishing service of all filings as required by applicable court rules. For this purpose, filers may use the mail service, serve by hand delivery, send an e-mail, or use eFileCA as it offers the option of electronic service of each filing to the designated service contact.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"15\">Can I use e-service without filing a document with the court?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, eFileCA may be used to exchange documents between parties without filing the documents through the courts.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"16\">Is there a fee to use eFileCA?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, there are fees associated with filing documents electronically with eFIleCA.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sutter County Superior Court fee schedules can be found at <a href=\"/forms-filing/fee-schedule\">https://www.suttercourts.com/forms-filing/fee-schedule</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filings submitted without all the required filing fees will be rejected for correction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-file fee: A service fee is assessed for use of the e-filing system. The basic service fee is currently set at $3.50. This is subject to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment service fee: A payment service fee is assessed to cover the credit card processing fees.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>eCheck Fee: The fee is $.25.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"17\">Is there an exception to mandatory electronic filing if it creates an undue hardship or significant prejudice to any party?</h3><div><p></p><p>In accordance with rule 2.253 of the California Rules of Court, a party may submit an application for exemption from eFiling.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"18\">Do I need to add new parties when filing into an existing case?</h3><div><p></p><p>When electronically filing into an existing case, parties that already exist in the case should not be added as new parties. The only time new parties should be added to the case is when the filing adds new parties to an existing case. This could be an amended complaint adding new defendants, cross complaint adding cross-defendants, amendment to complaint naming a doe, etc. When new parties are added through electronic filing that already exist on the case, the clerk has to delete them before processing the filing or the parties will be duplicated in the case management system.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"19\">Can I upload all documents together or must they be separated?</h3><div><p></p><p>Documents should be filed as you would have presented them at the clerk window. For instance, a document that would have been stapled together at filing should be filed as one lead document. Another way to think about it is anything that needs its own file stamp should be filed separately, as a lead document that gets its own separate event code. Multiple documents can be filed together in one envelope, but each document to be filed needs its own event code.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"20\">Is there a size limit for the document that can be uploaded?</h3><div><p></p><p>35 MB for the whole envelope and 25 MB for a single document. There have been reports of problems that have all been resolved by calling the EFSP. If the document is truly too big, and the EFSP cannot resolve, please call the court at 530-822-3300 to discuss a resolution.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"21\">What format do I have to save my document in?</h3><div><p></p><p>PDF, however some EFSPs allow you to file as a Word document because they then turn it into a PDF for you.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"22\">Do I have to bookmark my document?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, pursuant to California Rule of Court 3.1110(f), a document filed electronically with exhibits must include electronic bookmarks with links to the first page of each exhibit and a bookmark title that identifies the exhibit number or letter and briefly describes the exhibit.</p>\r\n</div><h3 id=\"23\">Do I have to add OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to my document?</h3><div><p></p><p>Yes, pursuant to California Rule of Court 2.256(b) (3), a document filed electronically must be text searchable. For assistance, you can contact the filer support number for the electronic service provider you are using.</p>\r\n</div>                                   \t</div>\r\n                                   </div>                                      \t\t\t\t\t\t                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t                                                        \t                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t                                                        \r\n                              </div>"], "_template": "4fb7-4129-b1ad", "title": ["eFile Frequently Asked Questions"], "_type": "page", "parent": ["https://www.suttercourts.com/online-services"], "url": "https://www.suttercourts.com/online-services/efile/faq"},

The court may also submit your case to a third-party collection vendor which could also adversely affect your credit rating. \u00a0The vendor may \u00a0attach your wages and bank account(s), or subtract it from your tax refund and/or lottery winnings without notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"3\">EXCEPTIONS/TRAFFIC SCHOOL</h3><p>If within 20 days of mailing of the\u00a0civil assessment\u00a0notice, you show good cause for the failure to appear or failure to pay, the court may vacate the additional civil assessment. Good cause for failure to appear or pay is limited to \u00a0serving in the military overseas, hospitalization, incarceration, or a death of an immediate family member. You must provide written official proof signed by a military officer or doctor; an incarceration record; or death certificate to the Collection Division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that you moved is not considered an acceptable cause for failing to appear or pay.

The 18-month period is calculated from the violation date, not class attendance date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers with a commercial driver's license can only attend traffic school if they were not driving a commercial vehicle. Upon completion, the record of conviction will not be held confidential, but the conviction will not add a point count to the DMV record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you attend traffic school even though you are not eligible, the DMV will not mask the conviction on your driver's record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cases in which a defendant has failed to appear under Penal Code section 1214.1 are not eligible for traffic school unless the civil monetary assessment has been paid in full. A violation on which the defendant failed to appear under Vehicle Code section 40508(a) is also ineligible for traffic school, unless the failure-to-appear charge has been adjudicated and any fine imposed has been paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, you are not eligible to attend traffic school for any:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Equipment violation</li>\r\n\t<li>Misdemeanor violation</li>\r\n\t<li>Violation with a mandatory Court appearance</li>\r\n\t<li>Violation that carries a negligent operator point count of more than one point under Vehicle Code section 12810 or one and one-half points or more under Vehicle Code section 12810.5(b)(2)</li>\r\n\t<li>Violation of Vehicle Code section 22406.5 (tank vehicles)</li>\r\n\t<li>Violation related to alcohol use or possession or drug use or possession</li>\r\n\t<li>Speeding violation in which the speed alleged is more than 25 miles over a speed limit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you are eligible and decide not to attend traffic school your automobile insurance may be adversely affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For drivers with a noncommercial driver\u00b9s license, one conviction in any 18-month period will be held confidential and not show on your driving record if you complete a traffic school program. For drivers with a commercial driver\u00b9s license, one conviction in any 18-month period will show on your driving record without a violation point if you complete a traffic\u00a0 school program.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"2\">Traffic School Requirements</h3><p>You must pay the full amount of the bail, plus an additional $52 administrative fee, prior to attending traffic school. Once you have paid your fine and nonrefundable traffic school fees, you have 90 days to attend an approved traffic school. If there are any correctable violations on your citation, the corrections must be received along with your fine and fees before permission to attend traffic school will be granted. Traffic schools will charge an additional fee to enroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traffic school you select will require you to provide a court code in order to electronically send your completion certificate to the correct court.

The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice, but you cannot have a lawyer in court. In general, a natural person (an individual) cannot ask for more than $10,000 in a claim. Businesses and other entities (like government entities) cannot ask for more than $5,000. This limit on businesses does not apply to sole proprietors, who are treated as natural persons. You can file as many claims as you want for up to $2,500 each. But you can only file 2 claims in a calendar year that ask for more than $2,500. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may sue in the civil division of the trial court or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.</p></div><h3 id=\"2\">WHO CAN FILE A CLAIM?</h3><div><p></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">You must be 18 years old to file a claim or ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible, meaning you have asked the defendant in person, or on the phone or in writing to pay or give you the disputed property and they have refused.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">You must be the original owner of the claim.\u00a0</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">You must appear at the hearing.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">If you are filing on behalf of a corporation or other business entity that is not a person, you must file additional forms to sue as (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc103.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SC-103</a>) or appear for (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc109.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SC-109</a>) a business.</span></li></ol></div><h3 id=\"3\">HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO FILE MY CLAIM?</h3><div><p></p><p>The deadline to file a lawsuit is called the statute of limitations.

It is the task of the mediator to create a safe, neutral setting in which parents may discuss and resolve parenting issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Court mediators are skilled professionals with continued education\u00a0training requirements that include: domestic violence and its effects on children; substance abuse; child sexual abuse; family dynamics; the effects of divorce and separation on children; and the developmental needs of children.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"2\">How does child custody mediation work?</h3><p>Court mediators understand that parents know their children best and want to do what is best for them. The mediator listens carefully to the parents' concerns and ideas, and encourages them to listen to one another with an open mind. The goal is to encourage cooperation and develop a parenting plan that both reflects the developmental needs of their children and enhances the quality of their lives.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"3\">What is a parenting plan?</h3><p>A parenting plan, sometimes calls a Custody and Visitation Agreement, is a legal document that specifies custody and visitation arrangements. It establishes consistent times for the child to be with each parent on a day-to-day basis, on holidays and on vacations. The plan must be in writing and signed by both parents and their attorneys. The court will usually approve plans that have been agreed to by all concerned parties. Once the court signs the parenting plan it becomes an enforceable court order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"4\">What are some options for a parenting plan?</h3><p>Options may differ, depending on individual circumstances and the age of the children. Age appropriate examples of timeshares can be found within the\u00a0Mediation Orientation Packet online or within the Online Mediation Orientation class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions to consider when creating a parenting plan include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Where will the children go to school?</li>\r\n\t<li>What kind of daycare do the children need?</li>\r\n\t<li>Who will be the children's primary medical and dental care providers?</li>\r\n\t<li>How will information about the children be shared?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do both parents have the right to call the children when they are in the care of the other?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"5\">Do court mediators provide legal advice?</h3><p>Court mediators can answer questions about the court process, but they are not attorneys and cannot advise anyone regarding legal practices or procedures.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"6\"> How do I schedule a mediation appointment?</h3><p>You must have a Family Law case number to schedule a mediation appointment. In addition, parents must have a pending court hearing\u00a0regarding a\u00a0child custody or visitation dispute. Appointments may be requested\u00a0by telephone at\u00a0 (530) 822-3305, or in person at the Sutter County Superior Court, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Prior to your scheduled mediation appointment, both parties\u00a0must complete Mediation Orientation, which is an online program found on the Sutter Court website under the Divisions drop down menu at Family Court Services and also under the Online Services drop down menu.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"7\">Will the court consider what my children want when it makes a decision about their custody and visitation?</h3><p>The first concern of the court will always be the best interest of the child. Normally, a young person cannot choose where they will live until they are 18 years of age. If the parents ask the court to decide where the child will live, the judge may consider the child's wishes as one factor in making his/her order.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"], "_template": "4fb7-4129-b1ad", "title": ["Child Custody Mediation"], "_type": "page", "parent": ["https://www.suttercourts.com/divisions/family-court-services"], "url": "https://www.suttercourts.com/divisions/family-court-services/custody-mediation"},

The primary role of the Grand Jury is for a group of ordinary citizens to investigate local government agencies and ensure that they are performing properly and ethically. Sutter county impanels a Grand Jury of 19 members for a one-year term.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"3\">WHAT DO GRAND JURIES DO? </h3><p>The major functions of a grand jury are divided into criminal indictments and civil investigations. There are three predominant functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Civil \u201cWatchdog\u201d Responsibilities: The Grand Jury may examine all aspects of county and city government and special districts to ensure that the county is being governed honestly and efficiently and that county monies are being handled appropriately. The Grand Jury findings and recommendations are contained in a final report.</li>\r\n\t<li>Citizen Complaints: The Grand Jury receives many letters from citizens alleging mistreatment by officials, suspicions of misconduct, or governmental inefficiencies. Complaints received from citizens are acknowledged and investigated confidentially for their validity. If the situation warrants, and corrective action is under the jurisdiction of the Grand Jury, appropriate action is taken.</li>\r\n\t<li>Criminal Investigations: Under certain circumstances the Grand Jury holds hearings to determine whether evidence presented by the district attorney is of sufficient nature to warrant persons having to stand trial in court.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3 id=\"4\">QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE</h3><p>Pursuant to Penal Code section 893, prospective grand jurors must possess the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Must be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A citizen of the United States</li>\r\n\t<li>At least 18 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>A Sutter County Resident for at least one year</li>\r\n\t<li>Possess ordinary intelligence, sound judgment, and good character</li>\r\n\t<li>Possess sufficient knowledge of the English language.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>May not be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Serving as a trial juror in any California court</li>\r\n\t<li>Discharged as a grand juror at any California court within one year</li>\r\n\t<li>Convicted of malfeasance in office or any felony or other high crime.</li>\r\n\t<li>An elected public official</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the statutory requirements, the following are other desirable qualities in a grand juror:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Investigative skills and experience</li>\r\n\t<li>Open minded</li>\r\n\t<li>Works well with others</li>\r\n\t<li>Interest in community affairs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"5\">SELECTION PROCESS</h3><h5>APPLICATION/RECRUITMENT PROCESS</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>In April and May, the Superior Court randomly issues a jury summons for Sutter residents to come in and learn about the Grand Jury. Superior Court judges and previous Grand Jurors conduct a presentation on the function of a Grand Jury. That same day, individuals may choose to apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals who are not summoned by the court may still <a href=\"/sites/default/files/pdfs/GrandJury/Civil%20Grand%20Jury%20Application.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">apply</a>. The court accepts applications year-round. To be considered for the current year\u2019s grand jury, apply by the due date April 1st. If the application is turned in after the due date, the court will consider the applicant for the following year\u2019s grand Jury.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>INTERVIEW</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates are then selected to interview with a Superior Court judge. The individuals found to be most qualified will be nominated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>DRAWING OF GRAND JURY</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The persons nominated by the Court will be summoned to attend the Grand Jury oath of office on July 1, 2019. The names or the nominees are placed in a box and nineteen names are drawn by random selection. The nineteen members then proceed to take an oath of office. The remaining individuals who are not selected will be the alternates. If, during the year, a vacancy occurs, a selection to fill this vacancy is made from the remaining individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>ORIENTATION</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>An orientation and training program for grand jurors and alternates will be held in the month of July in Marysville. \u00a0Attendance at this orientation is extremely valuable and is highly encouraged. \u00a0</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"6\">TERMS OF SERVICE</h3><p>Persons selected for Grand Jury service must make a commitment to serve a minimum of three days per week for a period of one year (July 1 through June 30).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not uncommon for Grand Jury members to serve four and sometimes five days of a given week. The average time commitment can range from 4 to 10 hours a week with an increase in hours when preparing the <a href=\"https://www.suttercourts.com/general-info/grand-jury/reports\">Grand Jury report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serving as a Grand Juror consumes many hours.\u00a0 It is essential that all Civil Grand Jurors be in attendance each session. A full body of jurors is essential for productive discussion of issues and decision-making. Each prospective grand juror should sincerely and thoughtfully weight in any and all family, personal, and business obligations before accepting this nomination.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"7\">COMPENSATION</h3><p>Grand Jurors are compensated fifteen dollars per day for each day\u2019s attendance as a grand juror. In addition, jurors are reimbursed for mileage.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"8\">ORGANIZATION OF THE GRAND JURY</h3><p>The Civil Grand Jury is divided into committees, each of which concentrates its attention on the investigation of certain departments or functions of city or county government. All committees visit various county facilities, meet with county officials and develop recommendations for improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current Grand Jury Committees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Audit and Finance</li>\r\n\t<li>Local Government</li>\r\n\t<li>Criminal Justice</li>\r\n\t<li>Education</li>\r\n\t<li>Fire and Safety Services</li>\r\n\t<li>Human Services</li>\r\n\t<li>Planning and Environment</li>\r\n\t<li>Public Buildings and Properties</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the Grand Jury's term, a final report is prepared with each committee's recommendations and sent to the County Board of Supervisors for response within ninety days. Copies of the final report are distributed to public officials, libraries, and the news media.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"9\">HOW DO I SUBMIT A COMPLAINT?</h3><p>You may submit a complaint to the Grand Jury completing\u00a0the <a href=\"/sites/default/files/pdfs/GrandJury/GRAND%20JURY%20citizen%20complaint%20form.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">complaint\u00a0form</a>. You are encouraged to attach additional information or documents that contribute information to your concern.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After filling out the form, print the document, sign it attesting to the information, and mail to the P.O. Box address noted on the form. \u00a0You may also turn in the form to the court.

These options are described in a reminder notice sent to the address listed on the citation. You must take action to resolve or contest your citation by the appearance date written at the bottom of the citation. If you do not take action, an additional civil assessment of $325 will be added to the amount owed unless you provide written proof of \"good cause\" for your failure to appear. In addition to the civil assessment of $325, a hold may be placed on your driver's license (pursuant to vehicle code 40509/40509.5). Lastly, if you fail to appear the court may find you guilty in your absence or in a trial by written declaration (vehicle code section 40902 and 40903).\u00a0 Failure to receive the courtesy notice is not an acceptable excuse for not clearing the citation by the appearance date listed on the citation.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"2\">TYPES OF CITATIONS </h3><p><strong>Moving Violations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving violations are violations related to the driving and operation of a motor vehicle. Penalties and options for moving violations may include a fine, proof of correction, attendance at <a href=\"http://www.suttercourts.com/divisions/traffic/traffic-school\">traffic violator school</a>, or entering a plea of not guilty, posting bail and requesting a court trial. In some instances a mandatory court appearance may be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Correctable Violations (commonly called a fix-it ticket)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A correctable violation is one that pertains to vehicle registration, driver\u2019s license, insurance or defective or broken equipment. If you receive a citation for a correctable violation, you may submit proof of correction with the appropriate fee(s), either by mail or in person to the Traffic Division. To establish proof of correction, a law enforcement officer or other authority as indicated below must sign the back of your citation or reminder notice listing each violation that was corrected.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\"><strong>Pollution Control Device violations</strong> may be signed off by a law enforcement agency unless it is noted that it be certified by a smog check station licensed by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\"><strong>Registration/Driver's License Violations</strong> can be certified by a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) clerk, a traffic clerk or law enforcement agency.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\"><strong>Proof of Insurance for VC 16028(a) violations</strong> may be \u00a0submitted directly to the court. If you were covered by insurance at the time you received the traffic citation but the proof of insurance was not in the vehicle, you can mail or bring your insurance policy or insurance card showing the dates of coverage to the Traffic Division. For a single violation, a fee of $25 must be paid to the Court. Multiple violations must be paid in full. If submitting proof through the mail, please make checks payable to Sutter Superior Court and include your case or citation number.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you purchased insurance coverage after you received the citation, you may mail a copy or bring your insurance policy or insurance card, showing the effective dates of coverage, to the clerk's office and \u00a0the fine for the insurance violation may be reduced by 50%.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you did not have insurance and do not intend to purchase it, you must pay the entire amount due reflected on your courtesy notice.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also have the option to contest the citation by entering a not guilty plea and requesting a Court Trial or a Trial by Written Declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/divisions/traffic/contest-citation\">Click here</a> for options for contesting a citation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are unable to pay the full fine by the due date see the information below for <a href=\"#4\">payment options</a>.

The court cannot provide interpreters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, a natural person (an individual) cannot ask for more than $10,000 in a claim. Businesses and other entities (including government entities) cannot ask for more than $5,000. This limit on businesses does not apply to sole proprietors, who are treated as natural persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a disability and need assistance, ask the court to help accommodate your needs. If you are hearing impaired and need assistance, notify the court immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may file as many claims as you want for up to $2,500 each. But you can only file 2 claims in a calendar year that ask for more than $2,500. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may sue in the civil division of the trial court or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court charges fees for some of its procedures, but may excuse you from paying these fees if you cannot afford them.

At any time, anyone may file a petition to terminate the guardianship. The court will order an investigation at that time. For termination to occur the court must determine it to be in the best interest of the minor. Even if the guardian and the parents agree to terminate the guardianship, the court must make an order for termination.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"2\">What is a guardianship? </h3><p>A guardianship is a court ordered transfer of legal responsibility to a specific adult for the physical care and protection of a minor and/or the estate of a minor. \u00a0</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"3\">When is a guardianship necessary? </h3><p>A guardianship may be necessary when a minor's parents are not able or willing to provide care. A legal guardianship gives custody of the minor to a person other than a parent. The guardianship allows the guardian to provide health insurance coverage, enroll a minor in school, receive assets or benefits on behalf of the minor and provide other necessary care and protection.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"4\">How is a guardianship established? </h3><p>If an adult wishes to be the legal guardian of a minor, or if a minor over the age of twelve wants to request a guardianship, a petition must be filed at the Sutter County Superior Court, located at 1175 Civic Center Boulevard, Yuba City, CA 95993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clerk's office will set a court hearing. Family Court Services or Child Protective Services will conduct an investigation to determine the suitability of the petitioner to have the guardianship of the minor. The report of this investigation will be sent to the court for the judge's consideration. At the hearing, the court will make a determination as to whether or not the guardianship is necessary and if the petitioner is suitable. Family Court Services will only conduct the investigation if the petitioner is related to the minor. If the petitioner is not related to the minor, Child Protective Services will conduct the investigation.

The court may also order Sutter County Child Protective Services to conduct an investigation into the appropriateness of a parent having custody of the child. Reports of these investigations are provided to the court for the judge's consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to object to a guardianship being granted, before the hearing you may use\u00a0our local form\u00a0to tell the court that you object.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Self Help Center has an instruction packet to assist you with completing the forms necessary to\u00a0tell the court that you object to the\u00a0guardianship. <a href=\"/sites/default/files/forms/Objection%20to%20Guardianship%209-13-19.pdf\">Objection to Guardianship Instructions</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once completed the form will need to be served.\u00a0 The <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl335.pdf\">FL-335 </a>Proof of Service by Mail form can be used for that service.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"6\">How long is the guardianship in effect? </h3><p>The guardianship will generally remain in effect until the court terminates the guardianship by court order, or will terminate by law when the minor reaches the age of eighteen. At any time, anyone may file a petition to terminate the guardianship. The court will order an investigation at that time. For termination to occur the court must determine it to be in the best interest of the minor. Even if the guardian and the parents agree to terminate the guardianship, the court must make an order for termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Self Help Center has an instruction packet to assist you with completing the forms necessary to ask the court to terminate a guardianship. <a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/Terminate%20Guardianship%2012-1-2017.pdf\">Terminate Guardianship Instructions and Forms</a></p>\r\n<p>For Additional information about Guardianships the state Self-Help website contains additional information:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-guardianship.htm\" target=\"_blank\">www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-guardianship.htm</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"], "_template": "4fb7-4129-b1ad", "title": ["Probate Guardianships"], "_type": "page", "parent": ["https://www.suttercourts.com/self-help"], "url": "https://www.suttercourts.com/self-help/probate-guardianships"},
