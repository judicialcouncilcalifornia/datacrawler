The Clerks reviewed the cases, determined what money was still due and owing, and sent notices to defendants who had not paid. This program is still in effect and we are still reviewing old files and cases. If you dispute that you owe the money, contact the Court Collections Division.

If you pay down or pay off an account, we will notify the Franchise Tax Board the following month so that the \u201cintercepted\u201d amount will be reduced. \u201cIntercepted\u201d funds include California state income tax refunds and lottery winnings.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl>\n                            <!-- End content body -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_template": "5644-419a-93a0", "title": ["Collections division"], "parent": ["http://www.yubacourts.org/divisions"], "aside": ["<div class=\"contentColumn\">\r\n                            <!-- Begin field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                            <p><img style=\"width: 205px; height: 136px;\" alt src=\"/sites/default/files/images/courthouse_rightcolumn.jpg\" class=\"imgborder\"></p>\n<div class=\"simpleModule2\">\n\t<h3>Contact Information</h3>\n\t<div><strong>Collections Division</strong> <strong>Yuba County Superior Court</strong><br>\n\t\t215 Fifth Street, Suite 200<br>\n\t\tMarysville, CA 95901<br>\n\t\tPh: (530) 740-1830</div>\n\t<div>\u00a0</div>\n\t<p><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>\n\t\t8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<br>\n\t\tMonday - Friday</p>\n\t<p>Division Managers:\u00a0 Kim Barnard</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Quick Links</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shastacourts.com/menu.php?page=collections&amp;anchor=\"><span class=\"iconArrowRight\">Shasta Collections</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n                            <!-- End field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_type": "page"},

The trial will be held within 30 days if the defendant is in custody or within 45 days if the defendant is not in custody, unless the defendant waives the right to a speedy trial (waives time).</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What is a felony?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>A felony is a crime punishable by death, or imprisonment in the state prison, formal probation or county jail and fines. If a defendant pleads guilty to a felony at the arraignment, he or she must be represented by an attorney (unless the defendant, in a non-capital case, waives the right to one). After a guilty plea, the judge will set the case for sentencing.</p>\n\t\t<p>If a defendant pleads not guilty to a felony, a preliminary hearing is held. At this hearing the prosecutor must show evidence that the defendant committed a felony and should be brought to trial. If the judge decides there is enough evidence, the defendant will be arraigned a second time in superior court, where the defendant again will be formally charged, rights will be explained, and a plea will be made. The case may proceed to jury trial at that point.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>When is my court hearing?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Contact the Criminal Division at (530)749-7600, Option 4.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>How do I either advance or extend my court date?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>All misdemeanors and felonies require a <u>mandatory</u> court appearance.

To do this, you must go to your first court appearance and ask the judge. If the Court determines the defendant meets the qualifications, an attorney will be appointed.</p>\n\t\t<p>When the court appoints a public defender, or other counsel, a determination may be made of the defendant's ability to pay fees for services. If the Court determines the defendant has the ability to pay, the Court will order that the defendant must pay all or part of the costs. Such an order has the same force and effect as a civil judgment.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Can I bring my child to court?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>You will not be allowed in the courtroom with a child.

At this hearing the judge will officially tell defendants about their constitutional rights and explain the charges against them. Also, bail (property, usually money, temporarily given to ensure that a person released from custody will return at an appointed time) may be raised or lowered. Defendants will be asked to plead to the charges against them: guilty, not guilty, or, in some cases, nolo contendere (no contest).</p>\n\t\t<p>In-Custody arraignments generally are heard at 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Field the first Alcalde and J.B. Wadliegh the second Alcalde.\u00a0 These were the first elected judges in Yuba County.</p>\n<p>It appears that the second Alcalde had little to do and he served mostly like a vice-president.\u00a0 Thus, he fades from history.\u00a0 While Steven Field was the first elected judge in Yuba County, he was not the first to hold court in the County.\u00a0 The first session of the Alcalde Court was not held until February 7, 1850.</p>\n<p>The first actual court proceeding took place on January 26, 1850.\u00a0 It is believed that the session was held in the old adobe building which was located on the banks of the Yuba River and was the headquarters of the proprietors of the area of Marysville.\u00a0 The judge who presided over the proceedings was one R. A. Wilson, who was the judge of the Criminal Court of the First Instance, Sacramento District.</p>\n<p>On January 24, 1850, Mr. George Armstrong and several others were indicted by the first Grand Jury in Yuba County.\u00a0 Mr. Armstrong\u2019s matter was continued to January 25 and then was continued to January 26, 1850.\u00a0 While the Court was hearing Mr. Armstrong\u2019s matter, a Mr. Eli B. Lundy became involved in the proceedings and thus, became the first person convicted and sentenced in Yuba County.\u00a0 Mr. Lundy was already a person who was under indictment for committing an assault and battery with the intent to kill.</p>\n<p>The best way to describe the events of January 26, 1850 would be in Judge Wilson\u2019s own words.\u00a0 He wrote this as the minutes of the Court as he had no court clerk:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe above-named Eli B. Lundy a person under indictment in the Court for committing an assault and battery with the intent to kill, entered the building at Marysville in which this courtroom was in session, and over the door of which building was painted in large letters \u201cCourt House\u201d while the Court was in session and engaged in the proceeding case of Armstrong and came up with his hat on to the place where the prisoner Armstrong was sitting at the side of the Judge and at or about the same time a number of other persons armed with guns and other deadly weapons entered the said building.\u00a0 The said Lundy then and there took hold of the prisoner and said to him among other things come with me and attempted to lead the prisoner out of the presence of the Court; and the said Lundy continued to use disgustingly profane and abusive language to the person of the Judge until the said Lundy was put out of the room by the acting Sheriff. </em></p>\n<p><em>It is therefore considered and ordered by the Court now in session that the said Lundy receive on his bare back 15 lashes well laid upon and that he pay in addition a fine of $400.00 and in default of immediate payment that he receive an additional 20 lashes and that Robert B. Buchanan the acting Sheriff see this order carried into effect and that an acting clerk of this Court furnish him a copy of this order which shall be his authority.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>History does not tell us whether or not Mr. Lundy got the second 20 lashes or paid his fine.\u00a0 As to Mr. George Armstrong, he was appointed counsel, a Mr. Rae.\u00a0 Mr. Rae holds the privilege of being the first appointed counsel in Yuba County.\u00a0 On the motion of Mr. Rae to quash the indictment, the Judge granted it and Mr. Armstrong was discharged.\u00a0 The case against Mr. Armstrong was stealing cattle.\u00a0 The probable reason that the case was dismissed against Mr. Armstrong was that they were unable to prove that the cattle stolen or killed were branded cattle since most of the cattle were unbranded at that time.</p>\n<p>This first Grand Jury also returned an indictment against several other individuals for cattle stealing. There is no mention as to what happened to their cases.\u00a0 In any case, the first Grand Jury in Yuba County\u2019s history was discharged also on the January 26, 1850, having done their duty.</p>\n                            <!-- End content body -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_template": "5644-419a-93a0", "title": ["yuba county superior court 1849-1850"], "parent": ["http://www.yubacourts.org/general-info"], "_type": "page"},

If you need legal advice, you should consult an attorney</p>\n\t\t<p>There are also some self-help resources available. We list some of them in the Self-Help section of our website.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What is Guardianship?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Guardianship is a court process by which a person other than a parent is given custody of a child or authority over a child\u2019s property. Appointment as guardian requires the filing of a petition and approval by the Court. This web site will provide you with some basic information about guardianships. If the Court establishes a probate guardianship, the guardianship may be:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>A guardianship of the person of the child (custody)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>A guardianship of the child\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d (property)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>A guardianship of both the child's person and estate</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>If the Court appoints you as a guardian for a child, you will assume important duties and obligations. You will become responsible to the Court. It is essential that you clearly understand your duties and responsibilities as guardian. If you have any questions, you should consult with an attorney who is qualified to advise you in these matters.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What is a Legal Guardian?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>A legal guardian is an adult to whom the Court has given authority and responsibility to provide care for a child, or to manage the child\u2019s assets, or both.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Who may be a legal guardian?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Relatives, friends of the family, or other interested persons may be considered as potential legal guardians.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Is there anything I should be aware of before I file the petition?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Yes. You should consider the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Is a guardianship really necessary?</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Have you considered the alternatives?</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Do the parents consent to the guardianship?</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Without parental consent, is there enough evidence for you to prove the need for a guardianship?</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Do you need legal advice or assistance?</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What are the alternatives to guardianship?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>You can make a private agreement with the child\u2019s parents to provide care for the child. A written agreement can be made showing that you have \u201ccustody\u201d of the child with the parents\u2019 consent. Normally, it is also beneficial to secure a medical release for emergencies, especially if a parent is not readily available. NOTE: The parents may revoke this type of agreement at any time.</p>\n\t\t<p>You can also get a <i>Caregiver\u2019s Authorization Affidavit</i>. The California Family Code allows a person who is related to a child to fill out a <i>Caregiver\u2019s Authorization Affidavit</i>. The affidavit normally allows that person, as a caregiver, to enroll the child in school and secure medical treatment for the child. California Family Code \u00a7 6550 provides details about this law. The caregiver form may be available through private legal publications or from a private attorney. NOTE: The parents may revoke your authority or override your decision under this type of agreement at any time.</p>\n\t\t<p>The law also allows parents to make other financial arrangements for property inherited by or given to their children. For instance, a blocked account and other protective measures can be used without the appointment of a guardian of the estate. Consultation with an attorney for these types of matters is highly recommended. NOTE: Some financial institutions, insurance companies, and courts require the appointment of a guardian of the estate before they will release funds on behalf of a minor.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What is a conservatorship?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>A conservatorship is a court proceeding to appoint a qualified person to manage financial affairs and/or the personal care of an individual who is either physically or mentally unable to handle his or her own affairs. The person or organization the judicial officer chooses to do this is known as the \"conservator.\" A conservator can be a family member, friend or professional person. The person who cannot care for himself or herself is called the \"conservatee.\"</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Is there more than one type of conservatorship?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Yes. There are two types of conservatorships:</p>\n\t\t<p>A <u>Limited Probate Conservatorship</u> applies when the conservatee is developmentally disabled. In this type of conservatorship, the powers of the conservator are limited so that the disabled person may live as independently as possible.</p>\n\t\t<p>A <u>General Probate Conservatorship</u> is for all other adults who are unable to provide for their personal needs due to physical injury, advanced age, dementia, or other conditions rendering them incapable of caring for themselves or making them subject to undue influence.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What happens after a petition for conservatorship is filed?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Once a petition for conservatorship has been filed, the Court will set the matter for hearing. A court investigator is assigned to interview all persons who are the subject of a petition for conservatorship before the first hearing is held. The court investigator may interview numerous family members, neighbors and others to provide as much information as possible to the Court to assist in making a determination as to whether to grant the conservatorship. When interviewing the proposed conservatee, the purpose of the interview is to determine whether the person understands the proceedings or has any objections to them.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What do court investigators do in conservatorship cases?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>California law requires court investigators to carefully assess the living situations, general health and well-being, and finances of conservatees or potential conservatees to ensure that conservators are acting in the best interests of conservatees. Investigators must visit conservatees regularly, review health and medical records, examine financial accountings prepared by conservators, and prepare reports for the Court on their findings. After a conservatorship appointment has been made, court investigators regularly interview both the conservator and the conservatee and report to the Court about the well-being of the conservatee and whether the conservatee's estate is being properly managed. Investigators review the accountings submitted at regular intervals by the conservator to ensure that the accountings appear reasonable and accurate.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>When does a conservatorship end?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>A conservatorship of the person ends when the conservatee dies or the conservatee regains the ability to handle his or her own personal/financial affairs. A conservatorship of the estate ends when the estate runs out of money.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What is an LPS conservatorship?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) Conservatorships are established to provide help for persons who suffer from a mental disorder or chronic alcoholism. These conservatees may be a danger to themselves or others. The conservator is responsible for helping to find a placement and mental health treatment for the conservatee who is gravely disabled.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>When is an LPS conservatorship appropriate?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>An LPS conservatorship is used only when the person needs mental health treatment but cannot or will not accept it voluntarily. Because the person subject to an LPS conservatorship may be placed in a locked facility, there are special protections to ensure that the conservatee's civil rights are protected. By law, these cases are treated as confidential.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl>\n                            <!-- End content body -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_template": "5644-419a-93a0", "title": ["Guardianships and Conservatorships"], "parent": ["http://www.yubacourts.org/divisions/probate"], "aside": ["<div class=\"contentColumn\">\r\n                            <!-- Begin field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                            <p><img style=\"width: 205px; height: 136px;\" alt src=\"/sites/default/files/images/courthouse_pic.jpg\" class=\"imgborder\"></p>\n<div class=\"simpleModule2\">\n\t<h3>Contact Information</h3>\n\t<h5>Civil Division</h5>\n\t<p><strong>Yuba County Superior Court</strong></p>\n\t<p>215 Fifth Street, Suite 200<br>\n\t\tMarysville, CA 95901<br>\n\t\tPh:(530) 740-1800<br>\n\t\tFax: (530) 740-1821</p>\n\t<p>Office Hours<br>\n\t\t8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<br>\n\t\tMonday-Friday</p>\n\tDivision Manager: Beth Barnes<br>\n\t<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Related Links</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/selfhelp.htm\"><span class=\"iconArrowRight\">California Courts Self-Help Center</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n                            <!-- End field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_type": "page"},

You must post the bail amount to use this procedure. If you are found not guilty, your bail will be returned. (See further discussion below, under \u201cTrial by Written Declaration,\u201d for more information about this procedure.)</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What will happen at my trial?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>Your infraction trial will be heard by a judge or a \u201cpro tem judge.\u201d The law enforcement officer who issued your ticket will appear and testify as to why he or she gave you the citation. You or your lawyer can (a) present evidence, (b) present legal arguments, (c) bring witnesses to testify on your behalf, and (d) question the officer who gave you the citation. If you are represented by an attorney, the District Attorney\u2019s office will represent the issuing agency at the trial.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What if I cannot come to court for a trial but I want to plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d on my infraction?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>You may ask for a \u201ctrial by declaration\u201d if you cannot appear for a trial. This informal method of trial can benefit persons who have difficulty taking time off from work or for persons who have transportation problems or live a long distance away. (Please note that if your citation is written for a misdemeanor rather than an infraction, you are not eligible for a trial by written declaration.)</p>\n\t\t<p>If you elect this option, you must submit your request for a trial by written declaration on or before the appearance date shown on your citation. Your case will be decided without requiring that you appear in court. The form <i>Instructions for the Trial by Written Declaration</i> (TR-200) outlines the process to obtain a trial by written declaration. The form <i>Request for Trial by Written Declaration</i> (TR-205) must be used to request a trial by written declaration. You can also get the forms below or from the Court\u2019s Traffic Division either by mail or in person.</p>\n\t\t<p>All forms must be filled out completely and signed. You must send in the full amount owed on your citation with the <i>Request for Trial by Written Declaration</i> (TR-205). The <i>Request for Trial by Written Declaration</i>, your statement, and the full amount owed must be sent to Yuba County Superior Court.</p>\n\t\t<table style=\"width: 360px\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"1\">\n\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td><strong>FORMS</strong></td>\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td><span class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/xbcr/cc/tr200.pdf\">Instructions for Trial by Declaration TR-200</a></span></td>\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td><span class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/xbcr/cc/tr205.pdf\">Request for Trial by Written Declaration TR-205</a></span></td>\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t</tbody>\n\t\t</table>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>What if I have witnesses or evidence for the judge to see but they can\u2019t come to court with me?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>You may have a subpoena issued by the traffic clerks and served on the person you want to come to court to testify for you.

If you need legal advice, you should consult an attorney.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are also some self-help resources available. We list some of them in the Self-Help section of our website.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Do I need a will?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>A Last Will and Testament is a legal document in which you give certain instructions to be carried out after your death. For example, you may direct the distribution of your assets (your money and property) and name your choice of guardians for your children. It becomes irrevocable when you die. In your Will, you can name:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Your beneficiaries. You may name beneficiaries (family members, friends, spouse, domestic partner or charitable organizations, for example) to receive your assets according to the instructions in your Will. You may list specific gifts, such as jewelry or a certain sum of money, to certain beneficiaries, and you should direct what should be done with all remaining assets (any assets that your Will does not dispose of by specific gift.)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>A guardian for your minor children. You may nominate a person to be responsible for your child's personal care if you and your spouse die before the child turns 18. You may also name a guardian, who may or may not be the same person, to be responsible for managing any assets given to the child until he or she is 18 years old.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>An executor. You may nominate a person or institution to collect and manage your assets, pay any debts, expenses and taxes that might be due, and then, with the Court's approval, distribute your assets to your beneficiaries according to the instructions in your Will. Your executor serves a very important role and has significant responsibilities. It can be a time-consuming job. You should choose your executor carefully.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Keep in mind that a Will is just part of the estate planning process, and whether your estate is large or small, you may want to create an estate plan. For more information on estate planning, please check with an attorney specializing in estate planning or see the California State Bar\u2019s pamphlet entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Pamphlets.aspx\"><em>Do I Need Estate Planning</em></a>\u201d at the California State Bar\u2019s website</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Does the Court become involved in trusts?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t\t<p>The Court also hears disputes pertaining to living and testamentary trusts. The person charged with administering the trust (called \"trustee\") is required to distribute assets as described in the trust instrument. The individuals who will benefit from the trust are called \"beneficiaries.\"</p>\n\t\t<p>Trustees, or beneficiaries, of the trust may petition the Court to remove the trustee, release assets held by the trustee, amend the trust instrument, appoint successor trustees, appoint receivers, notify creditors, and make other orders necessary to ensure the timely and appropriate distribution of the trust's assets. Check with a qualified attorney if you have questions or need advice on petitioning the court in a trust case.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl>\n                            <!-- End content body -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_template": "5644-419a-93a0", "title": ["Probate and trusts"], "parent": ["http://www.yubacourts.org/divisions/probate"], "aside": ["<div class=\"contentColumn\">\r\n                            <!-- Begin field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                            <p><img style=\"width: 205px; height: 136px;\" alt src=\"/sites/default/files/images/courthouse_pic.jpg\" class=\"imgborder\"></p>\n<div class=\"simpleModule2\">\n\t<h3>Contact Information</h3>\n\t<h5>Family Law Division</h5>\n\t<p><strong>Yuba County Superior Court</strong></p>\n\t<p>215 Fifth Street, Suite 200<br>\n\t\tMarysville, CA 95901<br>\n\t\tPh:(530) 740-1800<br>\n\t\tFax: (530) 740-1821</p>\n\t<p>Office Hours<br>\n\t\t8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<br>\n\t\tMonday-Friday</p>\n\tDivision Manager: Beth Barnes<br>\n\t<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Quick Links</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/selfhelp.htm\"><span class=\"iconArrowRight\">California Courts Self-Help Center</span></a></li>\n\t<li><span class=\"iconArrowRight\"><a href=\"http://www.calbar.ca.gov\">The State Bar of California</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n                            <!-- End field_right_sidebar -->\r\n                        </div>"], "_type": "page"},

After you file your answer, the plaintiff will file what is called an \u201cAt-Issue Memorandum,\u201d which is basically a request for a trial date. The Court will set the date and notify you both by mail of the time and place of trial. There is a filing fee when you file your written answer; however, it is possible to obtain a waiver of the fee if you cannot afford to pay. In order to obtain a fee waiver, you must file an <em>Application for Waiver of Court Fees</em> and Costs at the time you file your answer.

This legal document authorizes the Sheriff to physically remove you and lock you out of the property. The Sheriff\u2019s cost for the eviction may be added to the judgment, which the landlord can collect from you.</p>\n\t\t<p>The Sheriff will serve you with a <i>Notice to Vacate</i> the property before enforcing the <i>Writ of Possession</i>.

This change is effective January 1, 2020.<br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tHowever, if you have been convicted of a felony and are currently on parole, postrelease community supervision, felony probation, or mandated supervision for the conviction of a felony, or are currently required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Section 290 of the Penal Code based on the felony conviction, you remain disqualified from jury service. Additionally, if any individual is incarcerated in any prison or jail, they are also disqualified from jury service.</p>\n\t\tWe encourage individuals who have questions regarding these changes to contact your local jury office. For those individuals who will now be eligible for jury service and wish to serve, please remember that selection is random. The best way to ensure your name is added to the randomized selection process is to update your information with your county's local Registrar of Voters and with the California Department of Motor Vehicles.<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\tNo one is exempt because of their\u00a0job, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, or economic status.<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\tIf you are qualified, please follow the directions on your summons and call in or report as instructed.
